Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Have fun tonight?
No
They do to!
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom?  Kat has a date?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Never
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Thirty-two.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Will Bogey get bent?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Sure
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
She kissed me.
Yeah
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
I just upped my price
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Have you seen him?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
This is so patronizing.
And I'm in control of it.
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Unwelcome.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
How?
No one else knows
No, I won't go with you
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Macbeth, right?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
He's the devil's child...
Your life, and that of others!
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
There'll be a time.
What are you listening to?
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You defend yourself admirably...
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
Chief says -- how many?
Why do you wish to sail west?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
What are you saying?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What else do you need?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
I know.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
A cop?
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Vodka tonic.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Then do it, asshole.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Is it drug related?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Hey, honey.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Okay.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Where is escort service?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Speak English!
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Well, he...
I'm trying to tell you.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
I'll send a cop back for you.
How did you start the fire this time?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
How long they been livin' here?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Yes?
Yes, I thought so.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.

When are you coming home?
Yes, Daddy.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
That's right.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Certainly.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You're done.  End of story.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
What are you talkin' about?
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Not likely, convict.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
What about Luther?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
What am I wanted for?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
Surprise, Luther.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
You sure?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Yeah?
I don't need one.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...What's your name?
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Hello?
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
And the third one?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I'm so very sad.
I'm so tired...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Been here long?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Drink!
Got it.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Okay, I believe you.
I know.
Why the gun?
Hello?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Mrs. Christian.
I want to watch you work.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Why?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
I was well compensated.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
You're asking me why?
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
How long you been working there?
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I don't know, where are yours?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
Specialty product.
Alright, I get the picture.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I'm telling you it's not that.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Nothing remotely like this.
Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
Neil... Neil Cole.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
It's been six years.
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
No, you may not.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
What the hell was that?
It was Freddy.
Been up with Alice.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
How did you know that?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I've got to go.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
You do good work, Alice.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Yes?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Yeah?
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
As we near the Pole...
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Who with?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
What?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
He did!
Obviously.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Who?
Tell me.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You see it?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Yeah.
Hmm.
This way.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
What are you talking about?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Yes.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
It's pretty old.
No.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Okay.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
You and Mel Gordon?
Yeah, lots.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Strange.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
When did she die?
Hold on!
He's asleep. We were up very late.
It don't look right.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
No shit.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
I'm sorry, honey.
Your father never means to be so...
Daddy. Daddy, please...
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How you doing, sweetie?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
It's cut.
How we doing, Colonel?
Sir, you threw out page two.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Why?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Leave my daughter alone.
I know he left you behind.
Yes
That was war.
Four...
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
I miss you. And I miss her.
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Ted, what's wrong?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine!
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
You mean...
That's right -- premature ejection.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Request; life support systems check.
Sixteen 'C', why?
What should I say?
You folks need any help?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Surely there must be something you can do.
Well...not for another two hours.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
You okay?
He didn't recognize me.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Did you learn anything?
Did you talk to him?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Movement!
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
You son of a bitch.
Corporal Hicks!?
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
One of us?
Let's get the fuck out of here!
We got problems.
Seventeen meters.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
They cut the power.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Did you ever have a baby?
Don't go!  Please.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Where?
You might be disappointed.
Don't bother!
Is she a good fuck?
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Where?
Stop it!
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
Oh, leave me alone.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
I don't know.
What?
You're not going to do this?
Why not? Half the house!
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Go back to bed.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
I see.
Come back tonight.
What do you mean?
Leave him alone!
Gertrude!
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
It's just a trifle, of course.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes?
And the result satisfies.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
What? On one hearing only?
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Yes, indeed.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
He's here.
Am I not welcome?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Do you always live like this?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Papa, is this your idea?
Papa!
Father -
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Yes?
Leave that alone!
Wolfi!
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
No.
Love, Sire!
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Ah. Italian?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
What exactly are you working on?
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
How could I not?
Yes?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Oh, yes.
Do you have me?
I think so.
Do you have it?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
What for?
What are you doing, Herr Director?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Who is on this committee?
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I do not seek forgiveness.
I can't say I do. What is it?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Ah - you've heard that?
Did you try?
What?
Yes.
I've seen the manuscript.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Yes, Doctor.
Call me Alex.
You're a very beautiful girl.
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
I'm a werewolf.
Charming.
But, David.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
The zoo?
I looked.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Nice looking group.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Pecos Bill.
Plan?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Thanks a lot.
I'm going completely crazy.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
It's you, David.
Yes.
Yes?
What here?
No.
Remember the Alamo?
Hello, Tom.
No kidding?
Yeah.
Whose death?
What's the matter, Charlie?
What good will that do?
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
That don't do us any good.
Why not?
What do you mean?
Well, you can. You always could.
Well�
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer�
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Much better this morning, thank you.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Well . . .
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
I haven't any.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Are you sure?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it�
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
What time did you get in?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
Uhh, yeah it does.
What have you done?
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Beg pardon?
What?
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
Beautiful.
A bad idea.
What?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Boys...
You know you're welcome any time!
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
They're gone. What are you --
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Hell of a war.
That just might work.
You can shut up now.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
If I could go back to farming --
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Hmm.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Yes ma'am.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Really?
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Yes?
Are we here?
Yes.
What are you doing tonight?
You and...Luis?
Patrick?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Get married. Have a wedding.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Why? What's wrong?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Yes, I am.
No, no, no.
I'm just leaving.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Listen, what about dinner?
You saw the ad in the Times?
Carnes? Wait.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Patrick? Is that you?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
SHUT UP!
Don't, I'll drink it.
We are totally booked.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Just...say...no.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Jean? Sorbet?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
What do you think I do?
She's my...cousin.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
No. I'm okay.
Understandable.  Lime?
Your address?
Pardon me, but are you okay?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm so hungry.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
It's important.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
Teddy was killed last night.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Milo?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Is it your software?
We could move 'em up here.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
'Have a look?
That's great! Thanks.
Gary, I --
Wait... He knows.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
He's out of prison?
Who can we trust?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Please don't go.
Maybe it's the satellite.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Is that how Larry feels?
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
What're they building?
You seem surprised to see me.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
May I wash you?
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
We know all that, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Oh, and Austin...
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Hey, Mick!
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Excuse me?
I'm sure.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
I can't see a bloody thing.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Of course, luv.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Hello, luv.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Is it one of ours?
What are you saying, son?
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Ow! You shot me!
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Hi.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
In due time.
I don't want to.
Blow me.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Did you ever...
Well, it's kind of weird.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Secret ...
... love ...
... love ...
How long have I been here?
You
Then you can't come in.
Quite a collection.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
What are you trying to do to me?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
Such as?
The result would be ...
Choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
No thanks.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Yes ... ?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
You don't trust me?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Surveillance? By whom?
Makes two of us.
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
I shall need a small plane.
Oh, hello ...
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Insane ... ?
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Walk over to the window ...
You're better than I expected.
You're kidding.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
What?
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Man, you're losing your audience.
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Thanks for the advise, sir.
No, Cole, I...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
What are we having?
Are you going to have women at your party?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
About what?
Um... that's very relaxing.
Yeah.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Yes.
You want to share it?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
I'm not really hungry.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
-- He killed people --
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
I like what you've done with the place.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Thanks.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
This?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Brian, look --
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
I know.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Hi.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Hi.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What'll you do?
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
And the putty around the door?
Yeah.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Do you have to do that?
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
I treated you better.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
-- Burn them.
I'm working on it.
Alderman Swayzak.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
All right. What are you gonna do?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
You truly are a dancing fool.
Ho!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
What's wrong with him?
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
So that's what you been doing?
Good morning, Cheeba.
De-la-croix.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
We was coming to see you.
That ain't funny.
I won't do it anymore.
I'm wid it.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
Go away, unless you got my money.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Where do you go from here?
Nobody told me anything.
Do you know how you will use him?
You getting cold feet?
Hello.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
What do you want me to say?
How so?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
So they can be on TV.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
No.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
You've never had any formal training, either?
You sing and dance?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...not that time...
The good stuff.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Never read a book in my whole life.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And?
And what?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
What is your uncle's name?
O'Grady.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
It is my only object.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
By name only.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Yes, of course.
I see.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
West was one thing, but this --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
I just don't like it.
There's no need...
You smoke, Ray?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
And he'd been shot.
He -- He made me do it --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
So you killed him?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Bullshit.
His chest was hamburger --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
But not the only victim, right?
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
But you didn't.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Is it the truth?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Where are they!
Maybe --
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
That is the most unprofessional --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
The very same.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
What?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.
No bodies, no West...
What?
Think it'll work?
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
What are you talking about?
I was freezing from the hurricane --
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Pike never confessed.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Thank God...
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
He's not Army, it's not official --
See! The big guy likes it.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
The poet? What ever happened to him?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Will.
How old are you?
You must be Edward Bloom.
So I've heard.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Really.
Spooning the sherbet.
You mean, while I'm here.
Did I ever tell you about how...
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Oh.
How can I convince you to stop?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Were you and my father having an affair?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I do.
You need to go.
I talked with your father last night.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How is he?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Do you like it?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Ch...
Good. 
We better watch him. He's crazy.
No.
When?
No. It is too judgmental.
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't understand.
No I don't.
In every sense. If at all possible.
No.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You...
I got what I paid for.
Excuse me?
Please, there's no... Oh.
What?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Except for Small Eyes.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
It's a long way to go for a date.
You have excellent English.
At church?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Can I put it in your mouth?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
The fuck you laughin' at?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
What?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
Want another?
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
What is it?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I know that.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Huh?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
What?
You need money again?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
You got any money?
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
What's this?
Why?
What are they doing now?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Not a prayer.
I didn't know.
Hey, when in Rome --
Getting very weird.
What'd she say?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Why the hell not?
What's he saying?
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
You did great, Ichiro.
A wife.  She left.
We can't lose.
Ich said you left.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Might be different in New York.
How big a package we talking about?
One guy do all the damage?
Why?
Why me?
It's not your job.
I want a gun.
What's this?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
You had my help, detective.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
Also extraordinary things.
I want to do it.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Got it.
Day after tomorrow.
I know all that.
Not if it works.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I like you.
How old am I?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Yes?
It that mother real?
The best.
In your opinion.
I've already got more help than I need.
What do people do in the afternoon?
What's a long time?
Because it's not.
You know what I think?
What?
Where the hell you been?
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
You look... better.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Come where?
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Get out of here!
No, I'm lost.
So far?
Again.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Perry?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Doing what?
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Thank you.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Then forget it.
Why?!
When do you need her by?
Never drive again!
In the house?
May I please be excused?
About clothing?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
I thought I was here to meet women.
That's ridiculous.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Adam?!
But, Eve, I would--
There.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
What's baseball?
Yes, father?! Yes?
Juneau.
Yes. He likes windows.
Not on him.
Why not? He has great pants.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
You dial nine to get out.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
How old are you?
Whatcha looking at?
Hello.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Is there a problem?
I've noticed.
Yes!
What did you wish for, Adam?
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Should we say a little prayer first?
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Mutants?!
Yes.
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
He's smart.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I think...it...works.
Just be yourself.
Um... Eve?
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Where did he get all that information?
What's wrong?
What?!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
The criminals are winning.
What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Well.
Do you like the way I feel?
You don't?
Falling.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Are you a bad boy?
You like to open me, don't you?
Do you love me?
Who, Dorothy?
Alright, suit yourself.
Oh he forced you, huh?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Go where?
Nothing.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Uh-uh.
Good to see you, son.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Well, how did it go? What happened?
You want to tell me about it?
You saw a lot in one night.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You better not, Jeffrey.
What am I going to do?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Fuck you.
Yes mother.
Are ya ready?
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Any tips on where these guys may be?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
What the fuck are you doing?
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Look again for fuck sake!
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We paid attention in school.
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Hey Murphy?
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Nine bodies.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Uh... two shooters!
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
You... oh god, why?
My, my...
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The Greeks. The Italians.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What about one guy with two guns?
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Hello?
No. You sure you're okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
Worst day of my life, man.
Hello? You there?
Forgive me father.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Continue the joke.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Would they do that?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Did you see that?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
It had an alarm.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Where's the other stocker?
Yeah.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Can I get that credit card from you?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Yes, they are.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Hi.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Shh.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Don't panic, Anthony.
She needed it.
Who's Mr. Henry?
Get out of the way.
Shit, Dignan.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Next week we'll be drinking pi�a coladas.
Roger.
Any activity?
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Freeze!
I'll see you there.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Nice to meet you.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
That was a test?
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
No. Bob did.
Did you ever steal a car before?
Let them fight.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
Where you going?
Anthony, I --
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Let's not even talk about it.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Wait. Did he see us?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
So who's going to know?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
I told you they were there.
Bob. Are you coming?
My brother's in jail.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
You don't even know his name.
Bullshit.
Come on!
I'm sorry, Bob.
Everything OK?
I couldn't hear anything.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Is he in?
What?
Mr. Henry?
That's not gonna fly.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
She say what time I should call?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Lots of people...
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
YOU'RE A LIAR!
-- what? --
-- it hasn't been two years --
That's crazy.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
Where are you going?
I love you, too.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
No. You never worked Berlin.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I want someone I know to take me in.
You didn't answer my question.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
Some women like Dobermans --
Is it fresh?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
I don't want to leave.
We must sue for peace.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
What news of the north?
So I did! And what was so important about it?
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
Let her speak.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Thank you for inviting.
Tonight then.
Then when?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
They've tricked us.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Um... can dad come this time?
What happened?
Sure...
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Just. Like. Jason.
Straight up.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
So how's Tommy?
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
What do you want to know, Evan?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
Are you okay?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Why's that?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I just thought you should know.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
And...?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
It didn't feel like a dream.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
I should have known.
Does he know that?
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
Yes, Monsieur.
I won't.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
I'd better be going.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
Occupied France?
What are they?
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
I don't know the finish yet.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Hello, Sam.
Be careful.
Yes.
And I congratulate you.
Good evening.
My office.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
What, again?
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Oh, it's my party.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Then don't have a drink.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Uh, my watch stopped.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
Save some for tomorrow.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
They're harder to do than they look.
Well, not really, I --
No.  that was the last one.
Had a package to deliver.
I had it on the island with me.
Four four.  A record.
He's your cute thing.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
I most definitely say I am.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
The place is falling apart.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What's going on down there?
I didn't know we had sailboats.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
You're fucking dead!
You were how long on this?
That's all there is.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
I know.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
I know, I'm sorry.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I never said they were boring.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
At what altitude?
Migrants?
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
I'm stayin', Homer.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
In other words, scurvy.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
She took off in the night!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Guess so.
So what? We hide, right?
I'm going home
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
She up for this?
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Jake --
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
How much?
Come here. Feel this.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Something stupid.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
What do I have to do?
Mr. King, I think --
What the hell's his problem?
Don't worry about it.
You need to get a haircut.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Do you have something to prove?
WHAT?
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Stop waving that thing around.
Yeah.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
We're working for the King.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
We're getting a little old for running.
Do you have a ticket?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Stand up.
In over your head?
It's not history.
So what do you want?
You trust this Moonan guy?
No. Thanks.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I get it.
You want me drunk?
I. sold the car.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
I don't like it.
It's the truth.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
The debts.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
How did you hurt your hand?
I'm in trouble.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
It won't.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Wait a minute...
Do you?
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Ross.
Nice car.
She's my baby.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
You're talking about complicity.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
Bruised.
What's he doin'?
The key!
What was that, I didn't hear...
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Fuck that shit.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Well, there's the possibility of...
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Armed.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Hello, bomb.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Of course.
That is correct.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Any planets?
What?
-- open circuit breakers --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Not now!
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
That's correct, sir.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
What the hell are you doing?
What is it?
But I'm afraid of--
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I ain't mad at you...
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Thank God.
I was expecting someone else.
Whoever that is.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
That would be appropriate, yes.
Yes on all counts.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
I don't know what to say.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
As long as you're okay.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Unlikely.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
--a philandering pig.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Okay, okay, okay--
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Is that your final answer?
What happened?
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Like a spear.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
You'll know soon enough.
You have a request?
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
I'm sorry.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
What?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
People aren't that simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
So how was school today?
Who is Frank?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Don't you watch the news?
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
He said to follow him.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
How many times have you seen Frank?
Four times... so far.
Is Callie still around?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
If God exists?
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
When will this happen?
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
He was a year ahead of us?
What else?
Yep.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
There's no rule!
No more fuckin' for her.
Where is she?!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Mrs. Leeman?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
I'm gonna need more caps.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
What're you doin' here?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Hi.
Hi.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
Annette, just use your hand.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
My dress'll reek.
All right, then.
And the year before that?
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
That's enough!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
"My dear"...
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Father...
Yes, sir. 
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I don't call him, I whistle.
I don't want him.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
That was for you.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
Why wasn't I insulted?
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
That's even a greater honor.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
I don't remember.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Why -- why -- of course.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
They have noble faces.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
What do you mean?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
You stay with me.
Hmmm?
Yes?
Like this. 
Never mind that, I want my man!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Good morning, Treves.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Treves. Well done.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
What is it, Treves?
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
My... name is...
You look splendid, John.
That's a canopy, John.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Good morning, John.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
...my... home?
My home.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
What are what?
What's the matter?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
The second note.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Really.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Why?
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
But it IS! Look!
You DON'T like it, do you?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
I didn't mean to!
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
But...
SHUT UP!
What "magic"?
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Now stop it!
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Just say something cheerful.
Wait, Erik!
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
How did he do that?
Same thing, isn't it?
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Shut up!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
But it's a responsibility...
I must only let the red rage...
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Well... I'm game.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
And you've got BOTH axes?
No, Mother.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
You rat.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Okay.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
I'm not a stalker.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Frost?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
No.
That's scary sounding.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
I don't want to talk about this here.
So, um --
You're drunk.
I want to know you.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
Egad, were you horrified?
Not yet. Not married.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Seems too coincidental that way.
I wish we did. You married?
What are you doing?
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Have sex. Y'know --
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
That's okay. I --
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I just walked in.
I don't know. Panties and --
Okay. I wish you could come.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
So what's going on, Joel?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Boo.
That's a good one.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
He's coming?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Oh.
Nothing.
How do you mean?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
She likes you okay.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
You don't?
What is Debbie's position?
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Extraordinary!
I was a successful model once.
For magazines?
So now you're bummin' around?
Hitchhiking?
But Countess...
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
But Justin...
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Hear what?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
What's wrong?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
We've got pressure.
I can see the hatch.
Peters...
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
You can't, your orders are specific...
You... You can't do that!
Weir is dead.
You're lying...!
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
What is it, Smith?
I just finished drying...
Who?
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
He's been past Mars?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
He's engaged the override.
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
What the hell is that?
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Explosive decompression.
What is it?
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
I'm worried about you.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
'Course not. Strictly business.
What's wrong with me?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Hey! That's a prototype!
You're hot!
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Stop it.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
What are you doing --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
But I'm not done with the machine --
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
It's the first door on your left!
First door on your left!
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Are you still a virgin?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I don't know.
Well...
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
She's in my biology class.
No.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Poor guy.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
So what makes you so sensitive?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Who's that?
He is.
Just be glad you're all right.
How's it going.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Really?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
What variables?
Well I never did it.
Was it great?
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Does that ever happen?
I paid for it and everything.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
You better save some for me, you swine!
I think I better take you home.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
The cops?
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Adrenochrome...
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We can't risk letting them in.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Where's the tunnel?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Yep.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
My husband...
Will these boards hold?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Open?
Seven.
Got 'cha!
Move slow and move quiet.
Hurry!
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Hey!
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Let's go.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Let's go!
Oh my God... What is that?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Excuse me, sir?
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
My clothes?
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
What's up?
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Are you... are you hungry?
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
See you next weekend?
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Oh, Kurt!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Well? What'd you think?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
How'd I look?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
I know what ability you're interested in.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
I took the early rounds.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Take a walk, pal.
Oh my God, I look awful.
What's that?
To quarter-horses.
What's that?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
What'd you do?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
How's it sound?
You think I got it?
Mama, what's...
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
I'll be back.
I'm back, Mama.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
But what -- 
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Oh! Are you really?
...Did you really say that?
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
I'll have someone show you to your room.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
You're kidding.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You're an outcast.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
This was not taken from a grave.
You dance so beautifully together.
He always was opinionated.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
I've loved you all my life
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Only you.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Only you would think of that!
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Cabin B is ready.
You draw very well.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Alice? The others show up?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
How come you're leaving?
I don't hear it anymore.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
I'll be along.
Sure.
Somebody'll see.
Let's go back, Barry...
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
What do you want to be when you grow up?
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Jack?
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Looks like a storm.
Are you wet?
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Another coincidence.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
What are you gonna do?
What's your name?
Yes, she is.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
Yes.
He backed down.
What did you call me?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
What's this stuff?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
It's the bitterest of pills.
I promise.
No!
What did I say?
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Whatsamatter?
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
He says you were scratching.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Start the car.
How's it feel?
All I'm saying --
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Seth, if you were me --
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
We are?
You know what you look like?
I'm here with you.
How are you?
Who's "we"?
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Your prerogative, Senator.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Of course, but there's more --
I'm fine, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
Across the board, sir.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
I'm not sure what --
Yes?
Hardly the case, Senator.
California.
Yes, dear.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I'm sure it is.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Which is guy-speak for...
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
What about him.
I don't know, I don't care.
Well, now I feel so much better.
And how do you know that?
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
Any brothers?  Sisters?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
I think you're the liar.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Clear.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
What?
I like that image.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Animal, I can't.
Think we can fit up in there?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Most people don't.
You never said it was off the record.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
What's it to you?
What?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Oh, I'm not married.
Well, I think you're cute.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
And how should we do that, Sir?
You're fast.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
What are you suggesting?
Are you looking for this?
Do I know you?
We've met before.
We know.
Why do you need that?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Come on, old friend...
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Not again...
We heard it the first time!
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes Commander?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
A hologram...
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
Hi everybody.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
We're alive!
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Right.
You should have let me hit him.
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Simpler.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
What's going on?
Do your best, Tommy...
Okay... On what?
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Continue forward, sir?
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
No.  I guess.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
They are... friends of Congress.
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Any word from Canada?
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
That's right...
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
What the hell are we doing?
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
What are you doing?
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
I reserved a Cadillac.
So where's the money?
So... how many movies you been in?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I'll find it.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people �-
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
C-18.
Who is this?
What three hundred grand?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
That's right.
Leo spanked a waitress?
You just did.
The shylock's the good guy.
You pack a gun?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
What's it called?
So what's the problem?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -�
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Here's your keys, Harry.
What Get Away jet?
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
I'm thinking of a movie.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
That's not bad.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It's all mine.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -�
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Are you going down?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
But you are interested?
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
The turbine blew.
You think that's funny
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Ready?
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Maybe that is his boat.
Try Wednesday.
If you get it back in one piece.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
What, you think there's something funny about it?
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
That'd be my guess.
Can't you use something else?
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
What do you propose?
I don't know what you're talking about?
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Stay away. Or else.
She was sailing up north, right?
So what did happen?
Did you see him?
Epps.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
The what?
Showing you what?
What happened.
What's that supposed to mean?
Epps, over.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
Let the buyer beware.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
You're up late.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
We're still drifting.
Will you get off my back for once?
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Give up?
Not the Maxine?
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Are you going to yell at me?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
I didn't check my messages...
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Aren't there a million places like this?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Yeah, right.
I just stopped in to say hi.
What do you mean "why"?
Yeah, right...
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
What is this?
Look, that's back when I hated you.
He's insane!
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
We still have to go in there sometime.
It's always closed...
Where are we going?
As always.
I didn't get it either.
Ew ... when did you get that?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
Like what?
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Now are you going to get a regular job?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
You're insane.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Hello?
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
There.
Wow... finally.
What about me? Am I not even here?
A what?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I did too!
Is this one any good?
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
Wow, this is so cool...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
For nineteen years...
Wow!  What was that all about?
Uh... hello?
Oh, hi...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
...I better not...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
I had to see you.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
I'm just being realistic.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
No... forget it...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Please Josh?
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
Thank you, doctor.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
Starting now, we attack them.
You've never built in Africa.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
You never had it.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
We have hunted since childhood.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
Finish your tour?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
But you said they were always old.
What a good week.
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
Have you got it?
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
What do you want with my baby?
Everybody has a choice.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
His name is Oscar.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
Should we go?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
You've got to do something!
What now, Brainiac?
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
Who was that?
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Who?
Like a goat on garbage.
What happened?
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh?  What?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Ummm -- figure eight?
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
Are you all right?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
All right.  What do you want to do?
All right.
You heard it?
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Do you want this body?
I am Zuul.  I am ...
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Is that a game?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
In the physical sense.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
You could say that.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
May I please see the storage facility?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Nervous?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
So do I.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
That's what you told me two days ago!
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
I am their hero!
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Caesar, ignore them.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Yes, Caesar?
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I don't know...
God of passages and changes?
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
The Senators admire you.
They fear me.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
They're studying with Cynics.
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
You get to come alive again in the country!
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Do you always drive like this?
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
Will you take me home now?
Where is the car?
No, I couldn't.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
What's the matter?
GET OUT!
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
What are you looking for?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Are you going home?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Who screamed?
I'd rather not.
Where are you?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Where is it?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What?
What?
Oh my God.
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
No.
Benjamin?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Hello, Benjamin.
I haven't. No.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Why don't you get it.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Yes?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
On your first time --
If you want.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
What do you say to him?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
See if you can guess.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Do you remember the make of the car?
Don't talk about Elaine?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
I see.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You wouldn't.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
But if it's sickening for you --
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Mrs. Robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
I drive around.
No.
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
No.
That has nothing to do with it --
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Oh yes.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
No, I don't.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
It's Benjamin.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
And what are you going to do?
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
I don't like your tone.
I've quit.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
What?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Where downstairs?
Chasing what?
You were very different yesterday.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
And then --?
Go away. Who are you --?
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
Really?
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I know.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Why?
I'm worried about you.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
The Baron is tired?
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Any letters?
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Oh, don't go.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Please -- please!
Yes --
No -- only occasional jobs. 
What is this?
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Definitely off.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Can you pay some attention to me?
Insolent young cub!
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Exactly.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
You've decided against the merger?
How clear is Manchester?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
No news yet?
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And if you do it wrong?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Roy? He's always crying.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Yes, yes, but that's --
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
What is?
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Don't mention it.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
Up to you.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
I tripped over a chair.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
There's nothing more to talk about.
I didn't teach you that.
Are you sure?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
All? It ain't bad.
Mama!
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
What happened to Cole?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
I saw her.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
Roy Dillon?
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
You up to it now?
Yes, I know, I know.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Carter.
It's Amy Kramer.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
No shit?!
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Hey, you alright?
What?
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
He do that to you?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Where's the baby?!
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
I dunno, boy.
It's a bitch.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Home is important to a man.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I didn't tell you everything.
Can I have the Cadillac?
What'll you do for transportation?
Let's talk about it some other time.
And how were things?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
You invited me.
You're my buddy.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Everybody says he was so brave.
He worships Father.
College?
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Mhravitch.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Play?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Dad?
No.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Dad--
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
It's so--so stark.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
That's what you're supposed to say.
It couldn't!
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
A dozen?
Unless she has nerve.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Things.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
Honor, I suppose.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
I mean it!
How do I load?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
I feel the same way.  What next?
Are you've seen it work cures?
We have, have we?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
Here.  Finish the job.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Can't do it.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Jesus.
For what?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
Because he was cruel?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Something's made you sore.
What's this?
He's a ghost!
That's an interesting piece of news.
I didn't know that.
Mom?
That man is your father.
That's why I'm crying.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
Really?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
He'd assume we had.
Coming.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
You figure!
What's the matter now?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
It is?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
I wish Paul luck.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
You know each other?
Get out of here.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Not true.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
No.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Well, I want to...
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
You want a tip?
Just one.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
Yeah.
It's your money. You talk.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
And your wife? Where's she?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
I thought I was fucked up.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Where is he?
But then you'll forget about me.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
They are?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Who made it?
What plan?
You're talking about real excitement?
Well...
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's all right.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Sounds all right.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
You ever play Chicken?
I'm off that case. He fired me.
The guy who bought you that ring.
You're taking a big chance.
Jake'll take care of me.
Yes.
How long have you been driving?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Your tree.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Check.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
What do you see?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Eh, no.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Yes. Very much.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Why do you say that?
Over there by the courthouse.
Look, the ice is melting.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
It's so blue.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
You sure have a way with people.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Mother.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
At a funeral.
How do you do?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Harold?
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
What would you say?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
I knew you'd come.
It's a beautiful dress...
What's the matter with her?
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
What do you mean?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
That's all for you, Sammy.
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
The freak in the gas mask --
Do you believe in hell?
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Got tired of me?
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
What took you so long?
But it's not true, is it?
Hello, I'm --
Pardon?
It's just a puzzle box.
Let me alone, will you?
No time for argument.
We want the man who did this --
One last time. Give me the box.
You bastard --
Who are you?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
What do you want me to do.
Hurting.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Well?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Who did?
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Where's Daddy?
I have to see my father.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
No argument.
He's here?
I'll be scarred for life.
Sure.
You want something to drink?
No, not much.
First time for everything.
Oh Christ.
I got through.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Of course. Every day.
Never better. You sleep well.
I guess.
Really?
Finished?
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I don't believe it.
No you don't.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I beg your pardon?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
I'll come back later, huh?
'Bye.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
Not the point.
We can take your car.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
What band?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
How many tickets can I put you down for?
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
I have a television.
Don't do it, Rob!
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
What are you talking about?
May I help you?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
What's his name?
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
You look upset.
I dunno.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
What's the obvious stuff?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Will you call me?
I don't have your number.
Is that the last of it?
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
Those aren't mine.
Me?
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
What?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
No, but...
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Just local, of course.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Barry said its done.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Not in love, exactly, but...
So?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
It's a crematorium.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
It's a great song.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
You share a place with T-Bone?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
You haven't even seen it!
I'll call you.
So so.  Up and down.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Records are those big round black things, right?
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
You're very macabre.
Happy birthday.
Someone beat you.
Grave robbers?
Who?
What about me?
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
They do it each year.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You kill with your left hand?
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
I'm calling an attorney.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
I was driven out.
I don't know why.
What?
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
That is not me.
I'm your future husband, remember?
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Your father must be smart.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
You're insane.
Run!
Tradition.
No.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
That's none of your business.
Do you?
All I need is time.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Nothing to be sorry about.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
All right, dear.
The five hundred? Sure.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
How long would the interview take?
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
I notice you still remember it.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Then what does he want with you?
Allow me.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
I'd like to think.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Hildy!
Double-crossing swine!
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Walter!
How about Bruce's?
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Who do you want?
What?
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Let's see the money.
Boy, did you see her go?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
No -- don't out me off.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Where's the old lady?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Okay.  Forget it. 
You know it is!
That's good.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Hiding him where?
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
What good'll it do?
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
What's from the Governor?
Who? Me?
No, I don't think so.
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Pinkus.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
I know a secret.
Sod.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Ask her yourself.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
You're the biggest fibber.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Crocodiles! Aah!
You said that last year, Dad.
What's that?
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What about it?
You need trees for an avenue.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Oh, that.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Up to six weeks, I think.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
What did I do to deserve this?
Really, that's a long time.
Huh... what cone?
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Where's that?
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
How much further?
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
I don't drive cross country.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Almost there.
Check this out.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Fascinating.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
When?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Recover any bodies?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
I'm gonna go ask him.
I um... no, I don't think so...
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Aw, fuck.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
I just want to talk.
What?
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Ouch. Yeah?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Yeah. My brother told me.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
We are animals after all.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
I'll be out in a minute.
Yes, darling.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm just preoccupied.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
You were gone a long time.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Give me a bottle of beer.
Huh?
I've never been to Louisville.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
I'll make it up to you.
Thought you only drank milk.
Only when I work.
Why?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
How good is he?
Here, I got it.
Hey, Findley's here.
Well, we won't.
How do we stand?
I wanna walk.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Why?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
A son.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Findley.
Would you like to come out tonight?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Who's he?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
You better not miss, friend.
Long wait for a bus?
Yours.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Then why go to the bus station?
Do you always ask so many questions?
You don't look like a college girl.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I'm not sure... I don't know.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't you ever cook anything?
No, why should I? It's yours.
Would he know?
Why did he tell you?
Well, he owns things.
Why should I?
Where's Bert?
He went off someplace.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What do you want?
Have you looked inside?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
You and that damned garden.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
If we want it, it is.
There are more this year than last.
I had an awful dream.
I was so scared.
No.
They'll get us.
Don't go in.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
I have school.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
You have to leave the White House.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Better be. You left me for him.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
There's good news and bad news.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
What happened?
Dad, don't start.
You try Martin?
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Get us out of here!
Where's it headed?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
That's impossible...
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
What?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
I'm a dancer.
Oh. Sorry.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Your treat.
Venice, Italy!
Dad was onto something here!
What about you?
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
An old man's dream.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Doctor Jones?
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
The Grail Diary.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
It's important!
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
There were rats, Dad.
Rats?
They want my diary.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
My lucky charm.
Marcus would agree with me.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
I was the next man.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
And do I detect a rebuke?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Those people are trying to kill us!
I know, Dad!
Penitent. Penitent...
All right! Where's my father
What?
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
You understand what he tells us?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
What does it mean, Indy?
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Two are still missing.
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
And then they took their children.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Can you move your arm?
PET IT??!!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
What does the writing say?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Any more complaints?
Don't catch cold.
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
No... they won't kill me.
The last Sankara Stone.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Figures...
I told you, my name is Al.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
With a man in my head...
What was that?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Now what?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Who did?
You need ID in there?
I'm back.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
You'll be me.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Eat it?
To the hotel. To register.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Follow that busboy.
He recognises you, throw him off.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Joe, be careful!
Voice stress analyzer.
Even Rene?
You're doing great with her.
What if she says something important?
What Happened?
She's got the most beautiful...s
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Follow her.
Don't touch a thing.
While he makes the run.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
No!
Rene?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Bit expensive, sir.
And how do you service foreigners.
When you do...
Do what?
Right.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh....Sure.
Then who did?
I'll be right there.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
You are.
You talk to yourself.
Who do you work for?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Is that Ryuji?
What do you mean?
I'm just on vacation.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Hong Kong.
What?
Why not, what are you going to do?
I'll come back for you.
Now what?
That's twenty feet high.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Could I have it, please.
Yes.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Ow?...
What? Forget it.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
I don't know what he was thinking.
Do you want more rice?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
So, what are you going to do?
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Yeah?
That's my stuff from the office...
Thomas Sandefur...
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
That's right...
You eating with us?
Yeah.
So, is everything okay?
Oh, man.
Lowell!
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
I disappeared on you?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Did work.
What do...
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
No.
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Did he hear you?
What?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
It acts as a drug on the body?
It acts as a...
Object!
Jail?
Well, I wouldn't say --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
What part?
Who's the pigeon?
Who do you want me to kill?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
You're in a rush.
Grounds?
We rest, Your Honor.
What the hell is Botox?
We did not.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
How do you know?
You don't believe in it.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
Getting married.
He's passionate.
Marylin! Listen to me.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
From a -- girlfriend.
You do?
Oh Miles!
Honey, I could sit...
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hello Marylin.
What do you want?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
STUFF.  Got a light?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Pre-Castro.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Is this a lover?
Who's she?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
My client has ruled that out.
That's delusional.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
No. You're not.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Who's "Patty."
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami�  for the love of it?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
That's an evasion.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself�long ago.
Why don't you put me in chains?
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
No.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that�
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Driver!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
What for?
I never thought of that.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Now, just a minute�you can't�
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do�leap for joy?
Your ego is colossal.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first�then the tie�then the shirt�now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I�
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Egg. One egg�doughnuts�black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Santa Claus?
Thanks, professor.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderella�or a real hot love story?
Aren't you afraid of me?
That's silly.
What's the matter?
But what!
What are you thinking about?
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Any luck?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Me?
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Where's the bus to New York?
Isn't he here?
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff�much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Yeah.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Wait a minute, Gordon�I�
What's the thousand bucks for?
If it's on the level.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
What?
You send telegrams here?
What's up?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
What's on your mind?
Five G's�or I crab the works.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Who?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
What's the other name?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
No, I did not.
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
Calm down, Dave, what?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Hi.
Did they live?
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Are they?  Why would they?
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...and your General?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Was he there often?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
The assassination, Jack?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
What are they?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I understand.
I need a favor.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
I found out.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
This is your money?
Help us do what?
How was your flight?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Somebody loan it to you?
Who is this?
It's different with men.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Fifteen thousand.
Catching a movie.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Does it happen to all men?
What're you, a bag lady?
I go back to work tomorrow.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
You're avoiding the question.
What do you do when he comes home?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Why?
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Most of the times.
Yes'm.
You two meet?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
Uh-huh.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I have no idea.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Killian's.
What were you two fighting about?
You think I'm kidding?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Hi, Melanie.
It looks good on you.
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
For what?
They asked.
Beaumont Livingston.
I knew it.
I do okay.
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
That's a good idea.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I'll give ya ten.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Who's paging you?
When did you get out of jail?
So where did you go?
Where were you?
I lived there for about nine months.
About five years ago.
That sounds like a problem.
You live with him.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Whatcha watchin'?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Pretty sure.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Jesus Christ.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
How can I help you?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Ten thousand sounds high.
What's his full name?
Somebody already did.
What does she do for you?
Beaumont worked for you.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
She got off, huh?
I thought you might be asleep.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
In a way, yes.
That I gotta see.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
She's all alone.
I know where it is.
We're back.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Let me out of here!
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Well, how do I look?
It's short, huh?
That's right. We did.
It's hard to explain.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Hey, wait!
It was the window.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
No.  I see them.
What's your name?
Whataya mean, no record?
It's not healthy with it closed.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I don't want to know.
That help?
What happened to you?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
Lemme see.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
Why do you bring her up?
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Am I home?
Are we in Brooklyn?
Remember that.
What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
Sit down.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Oh?  Where you going?
Sit down!
Long time ago.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
What is it?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Lennox Hospital.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
That black car?
I don't know.
You in trouble?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Yes it does.
Goodbye old friend.
What are you doing?!!
Can we blow it with just two?
Uh-oh.
Where the hell were you?!!
Kay-Em!
Earth II.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Jesus what the hell is that?
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
Yllo, what's your head count?
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Fuckin A...
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I...I don't know what I did...
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Leave him behind!
I don't understand...what does he want?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Guys, he's right behind us!
My boat's neat, dad!
My cars. And a comic book.
Did you bring a check?
You got it.
You got it.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
Who's driving the boat?
Where...?
He's trying to sink us!
I never hear the whistle.
Where is he?
It's three feet deep, Martin
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
What have you got there, Lenny?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Over there!
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You know how I feel about her.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
I don't like Katrina.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
You're being really immature.
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
I try really hard, actually...
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Mine too.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Yup.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
Wow, dream big!
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
What? My eyes are not lying!
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
But you're old!
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Can I take your coats?
Nothing...
No...
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
...I said, I like your hair.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
What?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
What's Early been in jail for?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
...That's not true.
What the hell is this stuff?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Sure.
What happened to Adele?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
What are you going to do?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
Where's Adele?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
...Diebold?
Yes!
You're clean.
Oh man, that's the best.
You know what else?
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
Right.
Right.
Yep.
I hate this game.
Man, this guy is really good.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Casper.
Casper, where is he?
Right here.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Tonight?
What is it?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
What?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Did you bleed?
Passion...
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
It was... it was.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Then what's he talking about?
You're a lying bastard!
You still having a problem with this?
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
Did you know her?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You'll find her.
You're not going to tell me that.
Just for that no hint today.
How?
Have you any idea what the message is?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Do you like my dad?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
I'm busy right now.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
As large as castles.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Are we going to go through this again?
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Bainbridge Books.
When I was very young.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Alright.  What about me?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
What do you want on it?
You.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Peter...
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
It's not that easy.
I got lucky.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Yes.
The new Queen lives.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
The Fortress moves?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
But you suspect.
Yes.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
She must make a glaive.
The spiral begins in the west.
You're coming with us.
Even by you?
What business?
You've eaten nothing.
These we'll pay for.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
You!
Quell?
I have a cinnamon bar.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
A fine match.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Each to his fate, lad.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
But you would not stay with me.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Do not try your trickery on me!
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
130... 140...
Who'll I aim at?
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Come on, get down!
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Not taken.
Why?
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Mathilda?!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
...Yes?
How are you, Miss?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
I have new dreams now.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
What?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Mine.
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Your father?
Maurice?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
I thought you were asleep.
That's me.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
When are you leaving?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Where am I?
Steph.
Hello.
What do you mean?
Evening News?
I really want that watch.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
No.
Are you working?
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
How long have I been here?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Sera you are crazy.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't you like me, Ben?
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Your color.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Don't hit me.
Why would I kill my husband?
Were you with another man?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Because they got wet.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
I'm her sister.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Yes, you are.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
She's not!
And you know this for a fact?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
Okay, how would it work?
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
You're beautiful.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
No.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
No, silly. I go here.
Yes.
She's naked.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Why do you say that?
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
What will become of me then?
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
You come stealee tleasoo?
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Will you lead me to her?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
What make ye of that, Jack?
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
What magic have we on our side?
One more turn...
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Dolt!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
Shhh!
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Tis the truth.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
What have I done?
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
No!  I won't let it happen...
You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight?
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Biting you?
Pinching?  Where?
Step lively now!
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
You... you... you mortal you!
Is he a friend, then?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I wanna be with you today.
Atonement.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
He must.
Why?
I'm living here while I build another house.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You have to ask like that?
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I don't know.
I'll get your back.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
I can use your mom's.
I'm coming in.
Josh said...
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
how much weight have you lost?
Right...she married...what was he?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
How old are you?
I've got one favor to ask.
Uh huh.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
I forgot where I put my keys.
Hello?
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
No one would blame me if I left!
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
Sit down for a second.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
I need you to do me a favor.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
The garage.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
Oh...with his ear infection!
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Does Alyssa know?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
What are you talking about?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
I'm helping George build his house.
I can't go right now.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You never really trusted me.
Despite you.
I didn't go in your room.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Queer.
What did you say?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
And the baby?
He's a big one.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Sharp.
She's alright, isn't she?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
Sure, boss.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
I've never seen you in here before.
Can't you remember your own name?
I don't think so.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Oooh...
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
He's dead.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
What'd you say?
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
What am I gonna eat?
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
I know you're not talking to me...
How about some steak sauce?
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Mama?
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Appreciate it.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Is this a joke?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Where is he? He's late.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
Release the evil?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
What was it called, sir.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Looking for the chief.
Why are you laughing?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Hey.
No.
What are you doing?
Off limits.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
Where do you think we came from?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
How do you want us?
Do you have anything special in mind?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
That was a great shot you made.
Anybody we know?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
What's your name?
I'm very smart.
What's wrong, Available?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
You could have called me yourself.
Maybe... sure...
About running, dying what?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I wish I could help you.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Uh-uh.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
...But I still have the choice...?
And Sanctuary?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
What kind of jewel is this?
What belongs to the people?
All this. All of it.
What people?
I'll make the arrangements.
Come with us.
How did you get here?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Yes...
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
You recognize that guy?
Hello.
Okay...
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
In pornos?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Yes.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Sheila?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Have you made any charges against him?
Out in back.
No, sir, it's not.
What's your axe?
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
A videotape.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
It must be from a real estate agent.
Yeah?
You're up early.
What's that? Another tape?
Where would you feel safe?
I told you to stay in the car!
Was there?
They're gonna cook him.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
At sixty?
You like pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Mr. Eddy?
At your house. Don't you remember?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
All of it?
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
The police?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Charming chap.
What are we going to do?
If you want me to!
When are you going to start?
Well - I'm�
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including�  �the excess of virtue itself.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Well, it must have taken�
�buy and sell?
Charming, isn't she?
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
Oh, I'm so glad.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
You're lying, aren't you?
What is it, my son?
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Oh George, come on.
What's it mean?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
I don't know.
George, come back!
You can't leave, George.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
What's she got to do with it?
Why not?
You're wrong, George.
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
What if he refuses?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
A man whose life was empty!
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Ouch!
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
All the time, sir.
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Kay, I'm sorry...
So what's the problem?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
She didn't even know you. .
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
What's going on, Kay?
You think that's what's-happening?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
Do his job.
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Kay?  What's your 20?
I'm getting a trajectory...
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Actually, I don't know...
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
What?
Can you see the balloon man?
Oh, God...
What --
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
You don't remember me, do you?
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
Kill type?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
You can't run --
What?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
She spoke to me.
They don't belong to anybody.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Let go of the gun.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Sean --
I understand.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Lamar --
Sir, the press conference is starting.
I wanna kill my boss.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
There's thousands of units like this one.
What kind of cop were you before this?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
Howard --
This your work?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
I don't have any sugar either.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
But John was with him at the pool?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
They've never been separated before.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Thank you very much, sir.
As far as...?
I don't get it. What do you do?
He's great, right. Is he great?
We used to take baths together.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Bullshit.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Take her.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Where we going?
Quick drop. In and out.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Yes.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
So?
Ask if he said anything to her.
We look good this year.
How'd you unlock my phone?
I'm not taking her to a bar.
What? Did she say something?
I don't know.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
I'll get the girl.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
What did I 'get?'
You happy?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
You fucking nuts?
What the fuck's going on?
What's up?
C'mon, man...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
We don't need guns.
Eighty bucks?!?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Yes?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
You're from LA, right?
So you're our own private guy?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Yes. You're going to New York.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Why?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Man live by his rep.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
What do you do with your time?
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
I sure met some.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I don't know how.
Make it plain.
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
What do you think?
Why are you looking at me like that?
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Let some of us come down there.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
'Bout every other night, Red.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Yes sir.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Am I a suspect?
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[I believe you.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
So how's business?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
No.
Why not?
Potential? I don't understand.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
We're taking a different way home.
They'll be back in a week.
It hurts.
Yes.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
No.
I'm sorry.
Could I ask you a question?
You don't drink like you used to.
Then be trained.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
Bye, Mom.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I think it's nice he's American.
He has to go, Samuel.
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
What?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
What makes you say that?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Well, it ain't your baby.
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Oh, I'm fine.
Nothing.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
What?
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
Don't worry about it.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Thomas.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
On accounta...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Tommy...
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
Y'all mind the store.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
What?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Sixteen times.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
When will he be able to write?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
It's in pretty deep.
I don't get it.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
The bastards outconned us.
I think we could still have a chance.
How did you get called that?
It isn't always this rough?
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Of course not.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
You think he won't.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Excuse me, Sergeant.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
No, never in the slightest.
How much time do I have?
You don't aim to cause any trouble � But?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Damn.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Nice.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think�
No.
Oh. Yeah.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
How much money do you get?
Thirty dollars.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
What?
Oh!
Who, for instance?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Looks all right�
All right, boys, here he is.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
I got it all ready. Here.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
I ain't seen him for a week.
What do you do when you work?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What do they want?
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy�
Sure. Mostly often.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
How?
What's your name?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Oh!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Spencer of the Chronicle .
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
You want me to go up with you?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
I won't get away with it.
Tell my dad.
For now that's all.
Open your shirt.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
It rarely has to be done.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
Why did he do it?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
That's okay. That's his style.
About six years. My partner took me.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
And what if you can't live with it?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Hey.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Scottie, Scottie...
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
Yeah, they are but...
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
Okay...
She said I have a son...
Guests?
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
The new world.
It's not real.
New York.
Two maze runners.
Try harder.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
Someone you have to get back to?
You said we were on the same programming team.
It was a test.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
I wasn't with you.
Connect to public access.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
He's on us!!
Yeah, right.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Anybody see anything?
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... Nothing.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Hey, boss!
Just shut your gap!
Simon says...
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
THREE SECONDS!!
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
The goddamned bastards.
Whatever you say, Boss.
I guess I am. Just a little.
I got my partner in there!
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Well...
Inside, they were talking of you.
I can just imagine.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
You got something to hide?
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Come off it, Bugs.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
What the fuck does that mean?
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
What are ya thinkin'?
But that's an hour's drive.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
I must know more of you, my son.
I got partners.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
<u>Why</u>??
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...

You're really gonna pop the question?
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
You're acting kind of...odd.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?

Is there something else I can do for you?
Dating anyone?
I don't want to talk about it.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Aaron?
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
What happened?
Where to?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Let's send out a pigeon!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Tell me why!
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
"There's more light here," he says--
Yeah. Funny--
Waiter!
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Tonight?
Tunnel?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
No wonder--without your dinner.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
He's batty!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
I yield.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Goodnight, Jeff.
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Mr. President--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
Did you say--bus?
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Most natural thing in the world!
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
I know--but you--you're going to help.
And with your help--
The Steering Committee.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Lena.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
"So help me God."
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
That's right.
You're the best nurse I can think of--
What do you mean?
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Just a minute, Joe!
You can't say *that* to--
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Mr. President...
Senator Paine.
Order!
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Yes, sir.
Are these the articles?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
He did? I play the tuba�
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Yeah, then what?
You're acting like a school girl.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Boy, was he burning.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
What for?
Huh?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Nah.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Why not?
Uh-huh.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
No, I mean - about my client.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
No.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Brookfield just came in.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
That ought to be fun.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
Christian Svenson.
Yes, ma'am.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Take your time.
Uh-huh.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
...And I from Phyllis.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I've had my moments.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
What do you do?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
What?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
You do?
Yeah.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
...And?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
He told you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Hello, Lionel.
Martin.
No, I really don't.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
What?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Be specific.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
You're doing great.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
You like it?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
That's one way to put it.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
You got off easy.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Uh-huh.
He agreed?
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Is that the question?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
You don't think I'm insane?
Just you.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I can tell you anything else.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
When?
Yes... your particular approach.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Altar boys?
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
No women allowed.
Twenty.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
What did you find? What did you see?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
You know your history.
Can you swim?
The things that get you excited.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
You two!
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Tough break.
We gotta get her back.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Much less go outside.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Me, too.
What did he mean?
That boy's got talent.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
What?
You drink too much.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
What are you talking about?
I'll drive.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
It is?
That was too close.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
I think it's absolutely charming.
You realize what is at stake?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Yes, sire?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
A glass of champagne, please.
Bastia -- and you?
No, they're living in Nice now.
When you eat him, may I have some?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Good evening, sir.
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
Ah, that is good.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
No.
Were they pretty?
I cannot promise you that.
Promises mean nothing.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Open the door.  It's me.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I believe you sent for me.
There's probably some explanation.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
You couldn't face telling me what?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Well, let me in.
Who is that?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
$247.
I ain't trying to get in it.
You go first.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Wait.
Most definitely.
I did.  Is that door locked?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
You too.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Thanks for the help.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
20 minutes?
I know.  I'm sorry.
What you say?
Debo!  Debo!
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Take your car.
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
What's the matter?
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Elroy, what happen?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
I have a problem.
That's right.
How do you know that?
No.
Could I see some identification, sir?
You're out of your mind.
What...?
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Is that something precious?
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
No way.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I promise.
I'm just an accountant.
Who?
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Gimme a dollar.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Keep your eyes peeled.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
He never told about the money.
No, Ben.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
You understand?
Walt!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Is he hit pretty bad?
What can we do, Mother?
Amen! Amen!
Satan.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Tell me a story, John.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
It's all here.
Where's Mom?
John, where are we g --
I'll see to Pearl.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Nothin'!
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
All right boy: where's the money?
All right...  Come along.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Sure, that's no secret.
All right.
Can I have milk too?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
You were listening outside the parlor window.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Where's she at?
When did I ever?
The Drugstore?
Pearl and John.
Miz Cooper!
It's just a stupid cat.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
No.
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in anything?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
No.
Yeah.
What happens if they don't do that?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
I won't.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
I never touched her.
Thank you, Comrade.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Tell me... what else did you have?
An evening gown.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
How are things in Moscow?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Guest?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
I am, Gaston.
Have you?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la cr�me de Bretagne... 
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Razinin.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
What business?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
Gladly.
What?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
No.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
Is that customary?
I will start with you.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Ni-notchka.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
The bayonet? Did you really?
Room service speaking.
On which boat?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
Yes.
Yes.
No... go on.
Ninotchka, I love you.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
You must, darling.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Would that make you any happier?
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
All right, I'll listen.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little ch�teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Good morning.
We have nothing to discuss.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
What do you want?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
Yes... leaving immediately.
Raw carrots and beets.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
We could get that.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Yes ... I got the money.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
No, sir.
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
No, sir, you did not.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
I know it well, sir.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
Fucking hell.
But what are we paying him for?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
"Security" is not strong enough.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Sir?
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
What about the documents he promised?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
What'd he say?
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Mr. Castro.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
... little Bobby.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
She's quite pretty.
So, what's this about, Dick?
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
Jesus Christ!
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
... give me a break, Mary.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
Yes.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Thank you.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
No money in his room there?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Try "old" on for size.
Well what would you call him.
Hard to believe.
Would you tell me if you had?
Yes ma'am?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Carla Jean...
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
...Now that's aggravating.
You gonna drive out there?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...Be careful.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Just keep it up.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' where?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
You can't afford one?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
She'll be all right.
Why would I let you do that?
I know where it's going to be.
What airport would you use.
See about closing.
Now. We close now.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Sir?
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Well... I need to close now --
You married into it.
You married into it.
How's that?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
That's twenty-six dollars.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
Another additional.
Pot metal?
No sir.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Oww! My arm, careful!
It wasn't a woman.
Bad idea...
Yeah?
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
You're lying!
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You must be joking.
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Do you know who I am?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
"Thirty-two?"
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
...what're you saying?
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
It's all right.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Maroon.  I stole it.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
I gotta go.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
David, please --
George...
So, call me when you --
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
I got you, Del...
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Really?
What's his real name?
I'll go to the Hospital.
It's something I had to do. For David.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
I got this apartment with a guy.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
He has a wife?!
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Does he know you think he's real?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Where are you going?
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Fine. You got five...
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
That's right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Should I kill him now?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Half.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
What do you mean?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Jesus Christ!
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
Hmm?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Would you say she was ambitious?
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Her show?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
What do we do now, Everett?
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Vernon Waldrip.
Not out the other side his face, though.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Not your...
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Uh-huh.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
I am. Hur you?
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
...Yeah?
Yes, Sir.
Hi, Byron.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Who gave you this idea?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Good morning, girls.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Pity you don't have the character.
Mayo, are those your friends?
Yes, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I didn't call you anything before that.
No, sir!
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Where are you from, boy?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
You serious about having him over?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No. I never feel like that.
Really?
Not me.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
Are those for me?
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Twenty-two years ago.
I'm looking for Sid.
Why'd he do it?
I'd like to come with you.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
You okay?
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Do you know that for sure?
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Remember that.
What?  What do you want me to do?
I can't...
Th --
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Open it.
Cell phone.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
I mean it!
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
A what?
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Shoulda got an apartment.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
What do they want?
"What we want is in that room."
Say fuck.
I don't know, why?
Got him!
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
Call Dad!
He won't even know who it was.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Yeah... whatever you say.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
I don't know. Look around man.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Can you make a deal with them?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Jesus...
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
We need money first...
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
So what's the deal?
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
I don't know.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
What, I don't know how you mean?
Yeah.
Just a kid.
Huh?
Nothing.
Fuck is up?!
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
This cool the heat off you any?
Where is he?.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
No.
You call that a compliment?
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You got salt last week.
You look well, Charlotte.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
That is a separate issue.
Probably.
And the Governor?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
Did your father teach you humility?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
Father?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Cheraw Falls.
Please.
One of yours?
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
Where is he now?
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
How many men have we seen die?
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
For what?
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Worse.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Bite?
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Yes.
No-I guess not.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Is he really all right?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Ellie--
What were you listening to?
I can hardly read these.
Going to tell Ellie?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
I'm not climbing that.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Almost there, Louis.
You keep saying that.
Can I have another one?
What?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
She's finally asleep.
Thank you, Louis.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
There's ... another exit?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Nor did you, I noticed.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Say again?
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Tortuga?
Wait -- what about the pistol?
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
Are you certain this is the right way?
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You haven't seen it.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
... no.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Oh no?  Smell this.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What did security say?
The replicators?
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
You're afraid of him.
Yes?
Is that so?
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
You're insane.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Is something wrong?
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Probably the caffeine.
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
That's going to fit me?
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
Where is it?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Indeed? How interesting.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
May I use your telephone?
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
For what?
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Of course I am Stewart.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves�
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I�
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening�
I knew your managing editor very well.
Yale '21, I believe.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Yeah!
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Impossible. Put it on again.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Look, I quit!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Gloria Golden?
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account�
It has been alleged - yes�
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
What play?
No!
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it�
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
It's the smoke.
Not since you broke into society.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Hello, Stew.
Okay.
Been where?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Good morning, everybody�  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Yes - the worm!
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
You try it.
Yes, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
That's puttering, sir.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
What?
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Does it look okay?
Bud brought it to me.
What is that?
How was your day?
I told you where I was.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
But where would we go?
It's six-thirty ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Okay, that's IT!!!
No. What?
Are you alright?  What is it?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Well--it was dark out ...
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
What?
Yes.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Play along?
What?
So what's the point?
They don't have that kind of potential.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
... Yeah.
Sure.
And you're sure about this?
Keeps going ...
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
So what's it like?
What's that like?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
What department store did they go to?
McGinty's.
What the hell's going on!
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
EXCUSE ME?
Bud ...
Forget about that!
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Well don't you?
Really?
Yeah.
Free?
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
So you can't talk to me?
This is "Fly With Us?"
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
I....please don't do this.
I'm in my bedroom.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
...yeah.....
...yeah....well you have me now.
No.
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
No. I'm sorry.
I don't have a girlfriend --
Are you telling me no?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Not very well.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Do you want to pick me up?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
What happened?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
...yes I did...?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
If you come to Hawaii --
Really?
Where do you have to go?
Yeah.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
The police are on their way.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
Barry Egan.
What's that for?
-- and this is confidential?
337.....I'm sorry....
Can you say that my name is Jack?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Who is this?
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
....now: this pudding?
Hi.
Please don't do this.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
You have another house somewhere or something?
What are you doing?
I'll see you there.
Your expenses are your own.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
So...did my brother call you?
It's fine.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Why not?
What? What've I done?
It's not even noon --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
Enough to discern its tenor.
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
AND DID YOU?
Was it impotence?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
I have.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
He'll do no such thing.
How is the patient faring?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Is it awfully violent?
Most assuredly.
It's a long story, this one.
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
...yes, I've got that bit...
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
That poor woman.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Who are you, sir?
The actor
Uh-hub.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
There. That's right.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Marion--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
I will not have this in my home.
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
Huh?
I wanna see the picture today
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Like a bug.
This better be good
Yes.
Sorry to disappoint.
Listen to me-
I'll hire you  -- right now-
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Why her?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Jesus Christ --
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
It's too late. The movie's made
You gonna watch?
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
You talked to New York?
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
How 'bout a real drink?
This looks done.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Answer me when I talk to you.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Go 'head.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
C'mon, Joey.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
What?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Who asked you?
No, I'm not.
Yeah, what?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Jake, no --
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Why don't you just call him?
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
But they don't have a case against you.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
His wife took a trip.
Thanks.
Feel a little foolish?
Who left -- where?
If possible -- both.
I can't do that.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
I'll send you some comic books.
Something wrong?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Hello.
Why should I?
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
No.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
You're never going to marry?
We've progressed emotionally in --
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
He and his wife splitting up?
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
What are you two talking about?
Smart girl.
What about the rest?
Goodnight, you idiot.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Something big going on somewhere?
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Tired?
That's good news.
I wish there was one I wanted.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
I have one now.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
That's what the witnesses told him.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I do?
Huh?
Do you like it?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.
What's happening?
What you say your name was?
Yeah.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You still want to go home, Moose?
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Shoot, Jimbo.
What would you do, Dad?
Will you let him tell it!
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
Except yourself!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Sorry.
Excuse us a minute?
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
What's that pounding?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
I know.  That's why I came back.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Isn't he schizoid?
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Wash up and go home.
I don't know why--!
They never do.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Plato!
Hi.  I saw you before.
See?
Who lives?
The kids take me.
No--I was just--maybe--
Why did you do that?
How many rooms do you think there are?
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
So do you.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
What?
That one?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
She's being called for.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
No.  Why?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
A man of some travels.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
He wants... your "sister"...
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Gabriel!
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Yes it was all you --
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
Get the hell off of me!
Nick, please, it's me --
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
I love you, Nick...
They all are. Football's on.
I'm glad it was me.
What?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
You said it a million times!
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
She says a lot of things.
Wish I had a brother like you.
Samantha.
We walked the place for a week.
Do I get a country-western name?
...never... tried...
Got something to say to me, Nick?
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
Six men means six guns.
Get in the CAR!
Take 'em.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
...so where is he?
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
That motherfucker --
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
You want that for here or to go?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Haven't thought about it.
Hot chocolate.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Do what?
You gave them me.
That's what it looks like!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Yes.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Bullshit.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
...What bar?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
What do you care?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Don't ask me that.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
For all I know, you're the rat.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
So that was why she tried to run away.
I'll make the soap myself.
It's going to Sonora.
Where you going?
Why?
Which ranch?
That's right.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
I've got eleven horses.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Half of them are mine.
What did you come back for?
Is that the only reason you came back?
Kind of sore.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Just a thing I was workin' on.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
And we're running out of that.
Everybody knows --
What for?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
And you've got me all figured out?
But you're his brother.
She was only teasin'.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Hey, Brenda.
It's coming!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
No. I never date outside my race.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Can you feel that?
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
What are we gonna do?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Saw who?!
Here you go, Professor.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Right. What about condoms?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Professor, we need to talk.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Yes.
I woke up naked, too.
Oh, boy! 
What happened?
0h, shit!
Hi!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Goodnight, honey.
What did you just say?
So you do drink?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
State your name, please.
Marvin A. Pickles.
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
I do, please.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
He's a good boy.
Certainly not!
Man, that one made me puke!
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Which room is it?
Drink.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
Redi's all right.
Nothing.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Good.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -�
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
She'll have to know some time.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
And you believe that?
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
One believes -� it's like any other religion...
I haven't said anything of the sort.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
But she was here?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
That makes it all the more difficult ��
Yes?
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
Ann?
Have you ever been on television?
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
So what about kids?
Do you want me to?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Can we look at one?
No.
Like what?
You just ask them questions?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
So you lied to her?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
But if you were?
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Like maybe a big part?
But I'm not.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
You've made your point.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
You son of a bitch!!
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Questions about sex.
What!?
Because I wanted to.
I can't believe you did that!!
You couldn't do it, period.
About what?
You just want to ask me questions?
And that's all?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Prettier than Ann?
No.
Cynthia, I don't know.
Who said I was jealous?
I want to see you.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Right.
No.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Really. How'd it go?
What tapes?
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Jesus!
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Yes.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
What happened?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
Yes?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
Huh?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
You got it!
Out of self comes selflessness.
He was a President.
Shove it, Ralph!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
But they only think they're happy.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
YOUNG BLOOD
No!  He's never done that before.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Farley!
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
She walks in beauty...
We love you, Baby.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
They're just leftovers.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Anything I'd know?
Um... seventy... something.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Let me call Christine.
What color is it supposed to be?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
That's what you do with every one.
Are you chewing gum?
Sure I know Maya.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what's the plan today?
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
What?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Could be anything.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
We're on.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You said it looked like a car accident.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Nice. Very nice.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Maya.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
So what's happening with your book?
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
French or American?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
There's dust in it.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Daddy.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Explain, act crazy?
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
They're on the roof.
How do they know it's over?
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Graham.
Oh.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
What about Isabelle?
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
And three weeks.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
No money, eh?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
What friend is that?
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Ten A.M.
Offend anybody lately?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
What's Turley like?
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Howdy.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
We'd rather stay.
Rae, I need help.
It's been a while.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Stella.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
How about you?
I am telling the truth.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
Even the fall from the plane.
Simone does not control my destiny.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Better late than never.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Soon.  Soon.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Do what?
Excuse me?  Start?
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Where are you?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
... so much like her?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
How about the nudity?
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
You can't.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
I don't know anything about computers.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Not quite how I imagined it --
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Why didn't she thank you?
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
What?!
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Abduction?
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Dark?
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
What if it catches on fire?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
What?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Don't cry.
Are you wigging out?
No, we're not.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
No.
You were great in the play, Cole.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
They scare me too sometimes.
What?
She wanted me to tell you--
Excuse me?
Stuttering--
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
What are you talking about?
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Witch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Dammit, Carl!!!!
No shit.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Ow!
What's wrong?
Who? Us?!
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
How does it feel, Keith?
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
What?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Rorschach.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
I got to leave my post.
Sure thing, killer.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
I loved you. I loved --
When one sees you they all see you.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Seriously?!?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Well?
I would've come back for you.
Well, thanks for the lift.
I'll do it.
Or in the slammer.
No.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Shit! No one's here.
We still on schedule?
Save it. We got a long haul.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
What's your twenty?
Talk to me.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
Mortal.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Did he give you his name?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And threw us into the lake.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Are you on a land line?
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
What happened?
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
What'd you say?
Do you want me to say I did it?
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
...Does he know?
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- he's doing it then, huh --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
True?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
A Fed? Like FBI?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
I DON'T KNOW!
What else did Padiche say?
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
No, she won't.
He's dead.
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
Will she come back?
I wish you'd told me.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Perhaps it did.
Human beings can die.
What happened?
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
What plan?
Yes.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you remember?
You still don't believe in God?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
What's wrong?
What's happening to us?
It's all right.
No.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I wish you wouldn't.
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
When?
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
I'm supposed to call in.
Put it on my account, please.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
No dog.
You asked.
You put me life in danger.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Claire!
I'll miss you, Mike.
I like your coat.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
For how long?
Hey.  The neighbors.
Oh, some shit.
Honey.  You got him.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
I watched TV.
What did you watch?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
I just sat and listened.
Even Joey Venza?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Let my kid go.
Watch your step!
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
You coming in?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
What's in there?
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Can't focus...
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Frmpph-yrr.
Thanks, I already ate.
Even if they're not clever.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I hate--
But you like that in a man?
Don't misquote Othello at me. Besides, you'd have to care about somebody to strangle them.
What's your problem?
Do you mind if I come too?
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Well, no.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Peter, what can I do for you?
How much do you know about it?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
No�
So they're airing this tonight?
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Break it off!
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
You won't get off that cheap.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
You were saying --?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
No?
Easy, Animal! Easy!
You'll fix me up!
That's what I wanna hear.
May I have this dance, Miss?
Yes, sir.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
What radio?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
You told them, Hoffy.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
The what?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
I do not want those cigarettes.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
You heard him.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
That's where he's going.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Antonia?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Report.
Maybe they're not out there.
Captain, are you all right?
Doctor Soran?
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Why don't we beam it up?
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
... How long?
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Mr. Scott?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
What? What are you saying?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
You would have done the same for me.
... A cloaking device?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Would you look at that?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
What you ask is difficult.
Success, my lord.
My Lord... what are your orders?
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Physician, heal thyself.
That's all you have to say?
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
And who am I hiding from?
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
They even killed the galley chief.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Until now.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
David --
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
No!
Tactical!
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
We'll be going to warp speed --
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
And who is this?
The word is given: warp speed.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
That was close --
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Certainly...
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Implicitly.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What's what?
Wanna try it from the top?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Permission to come aboard.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Why not?
I see.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
Exaggerate.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Uhura!... Where!
Bearing!
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
The explosive override -- ?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Well, that's different.
Just use the keyboard...
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Sulu Hikaru.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
Don't panic...
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
A perfect moment?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
I understand.
I aspire to be more than I am.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really?
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Androids... don't have...fun.
No... I want to stay with you...
Won't he rust?
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
What kind of concerns?
Understood.
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Worf to Picard...
Captain...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
No, sir. It is a gorch.
You need a haircut, Commander.
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
It's Cochrane.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
I told you, there's no --
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
What's still there?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Where in the States?
Where are you from most recently?
Invasion.
Cochrane?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
What makes you say that?
Were the two of you... involved?
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Unless you'd like to stay.
Report!
Worf to Bridge.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Or not to be -
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
Stand...?
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
My God, what happened here?
Are those your words?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
From Starfleet?
Do we report this, sir?
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Possibly.
Aft thrusters -
Aye, sir.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Sulu!
Surely not.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
Are you dining on worms?
I SHOULD have been -
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Captain --
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Not as yet, sir.
A lie?
What?
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
This one can.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Yes, please continue.
Brother. I cannot move.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I do not understand.
When was he... created?
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
Yes, sir.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
We are being hailed.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Yes.
What purpose does this serve?
Do you have a moment, sir?
I'm going to miss you.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Counselor?
No.
How long until he can fire?
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
What's this?
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Report.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Looking up at the stars.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
All of this so you could capture me?
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
But surely...
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard�s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Praetor.
Benny, there's nothing there.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
What did I tell you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
What's all this for?
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
Smile... good?
What?
I am husband?
Who?
I want to try it.
Why?
Say it.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I understand.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
Nobody knows.
I am not a good singer.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
You don't forget anything, do you?
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
I understand.
Where do you think you're going?
Well...
Help me!!!
What? No, of course not.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Oh, Jesus.
To the same woman?
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
No.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
That's not sayin' much.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
Let's work it.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's been cooked-off
Is he dead?
How did you hook up with Faith?
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
About what?
It's alright.  He means it.
Strickland.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
What is it?
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
How's Zander?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Why?
Who's Strickland?
I guess.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Testa?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
This isn't in our database?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Dylan here.
You heard?
You have the body?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
A grill pattern.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Look...
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
At the field office.
Maybe cause he's smart.
I think I talked to him.
Its called insubordination.
What I do requires confidentiality.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
I don't believe this.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
How long have you been downtown?
You work with Koessler?
Yes I do.
You got a point there.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
There are Agency regulations about this.
I know.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Jaime? Where are you?
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
What was your weakness, sir?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Maybe you should back off.
You? You went by the book?
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
It's over for you.
Are you calling Her?
Don't do it, Mike.
I'm sorry?
Thanks.
Like the quiche?
It does.
Like what?
To do what?
Anything?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
Let me just check on my boy.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
On the table.
Sorry?
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
...It's really getting late.
Yeah, hold on.
Hi. Sorry about that.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
I thought you met someone else.
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Right.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
It's definitely a step back for me.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
It's kinda money, actually.
She was cute.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
We're going to Vegas.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
You think they're watching?
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
...gotta...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
We didn't do so bad after all.
No!
What?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Sorry about interrupting...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Yeah. You met him once.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
I'm sorry.
So, two days?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
What a surprise...
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
Yes she did.
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...Sue...
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
No.  You ask for too much.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
What's the matter, Carlo?
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
You mean Tattaglia.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
I know.
Where are you going?
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Jesus, I don't know...
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
What was that?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
You like spaghetti?
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Sure.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Huh?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
Do you wish to be baptized?
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Is he alive?
Is that good?
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
This is so good of you.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
I know. I write like a child.
What club?
Is Freddie here?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
So tell me.
Really? To Italy?
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Frederico!
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
What about Christmas?
Mr Greenleaf.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
He hates being confronted.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Marge, when did you get here?
Dickie?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
Randall.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Hello Meredith.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
My God.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Not guilty.
I'm fine.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Of course. What happened to your face?
I really don't want to see anybody.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
I can believe that.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Oh, Tom, please.
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Just what?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Oh, are you all right?
With the other hand, right?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Huh?
I have.
Hello.
A girl needs protection.
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
You can do it in my mouth.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Where?
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Why?
How?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
There's porno theatres for that.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Why?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
You would, huh?
Wha -- ?
It happens.
Spit it out.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I don't understand....
You suppose?
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
What, vou?
You'll stand by me?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
How'd it go?
I think  it's worse  now.
Well...
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Your dancing's very good.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
No, sir.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Are you saying that he's...
But I...
Yes?
I'm here.
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
I... I don't believe this.
Who the hell is this "they?"
I was decorated.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Well, that's not what they think.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
That was beautiful.
I taught you that.
What?
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
It's about me.
I thought you...
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
Ancestors?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
I was wondering...
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Is smoking fun?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
What?
Yes, but where?
Yes?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Yes?
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Gulls!
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
What?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.
That's the last of it.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
How can you tell?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
I didn't break that window!
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Famished.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Yes.
What?
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It smelled of the fire.
Of birds?
So they united.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Hear, hear!
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
How long have they been gathering there?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Do you want to try your father again? 
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Have you got a pencil?
I don't know why.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Help how? What do you want to do?
Then let's go. Now!
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I fear he may have to.
You must leave this house.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
But Richardson?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
But this woman -- and her son --
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
What's that you say?
You've no thought of going there?
He was a nice horse.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
I would make you rich.
What did you hear?
But where did they get those people?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
You've been with Gray again.
I think we should get some support?
I heard you were looking for this.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
I know her friends.
Your father gave them to both of you.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
No...
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
You mean Alex.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It's not what you think.
Sweetheart...
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Such power exists?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Yes, I have!
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Why not, Bobby?
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
How does he explain that?
You know about the United Nations?
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I feel different right now.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
What happened?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
No. That's all finished.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
They would have killed this man?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Should I run him through?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
With him?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Leave him alone.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
What?
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Ouch, my hair...
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
I thought we were goin' into town.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll hitch.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Ohmygod...
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Max!  What's wrong?
Are you following me?
What's your name?
What do you mean?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Let's go see them.
You're beautiful.
Nowhere.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Piss off.
Michael?
What about Mom?
So what's our problem?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Torch them!!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Load of bullshit.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Anything?
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
When was the last time you used it?
After all this mess then.
You reach anybody yet?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Don't let up, Childs!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
What's...
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
What is it?
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
You know damn well what we both make of it.
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
What else can they do?
The Hall of Books.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
When was his mother taken?
What's it all for?
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
Say I just come back again?
You took her because she helped me.
I just love mechanical things.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Got here as soon as I could.
All right, what is it now?
You're late.
Let's walk through the park...
My God...
Let them.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
What?
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
I can't do that --
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
How long ago?
Why?
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
All of you?
Every night.
This is magnificent...
The mud carriers.
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
How do you decide?
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Yes... I suppose so.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Might I ask why?
Why?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Sir, if I may --
Kalen...
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Relax.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
That's too bad.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
You two ok?
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
But no one knew until after...
Do you really believe me?
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Me, too.
How you doin'?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
How?
What case?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
It doesn't look all that different.
What are you talking about?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Why "of course"?
I'll manage.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
What's this?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
What?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
In the leg.
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Stop.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
Tell me.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
That's puttin' it mildly.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
You think you've found your calling?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
What?
Thelma!
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
What?
Thelma, that is not an option.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
You awake?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
What?!  What d'you think?!
You're a good friend.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Hi there!  You alright?
Where you goin'?
Oh, Jesus!
What?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
So you admit it?
Gay? He said you were gay?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Well then you've got to call her, man.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Dom? What are you?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Out getting coffee.
Who?
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
By the way, what's your name?
I know he's around here someplace.
Lint?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Yeah.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Huh?
Uh, that's okay.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
You don't think they're too big?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Get out.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Is it the frank or the beans?
Eh.
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
Zorin will eat him alive!
What's it about?
Yes it is.
John. How much time?
Still heading for Cuba.
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
What about you? Where are you going?
No you weren't.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
I don't like what's happening.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
This is a restricted area.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Let's see it.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Tread matches. It's the car.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
What did he say?
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What did he say?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
I desecrated it?
X21, give me a 20.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
You ever try solitary confinement?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
No way. No fuckin' way.
That's a big comfort to me.
It would have been really embarrassing!
That's all!
I saw one.
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
You let me make a fool of myself.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Why'd you do that?
That's true. What are you?
Does it bother you?
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Why?
Just good luck.
Where are we?
What do you do when you come here?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
That's missile lock!
This is crazy!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
Not anymore.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Is it you?
What do I want?
Why do you all have such funny names?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
How was it?
What are you doing?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
We did it!
Come on, relax...
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Time to go.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
What'd you do?
A plaque?
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
That's because you don't have any women.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
GET LOST!
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Three guesses.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You won?!!!
Yes sir.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
I can take care of myself.
How do you feel?
Or....
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
What happened to number five?
But maybe you can change all that.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Get it, please.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
But I thought...
Eight years.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Do what?
And you believe him?
Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  Okay?
I suppose you're not here either.
Mars.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Why would I lie to you?
I'm not falling for it.
I said get out!
So you dropped by to apologize?
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
What reactor?!
Aliens built it.
What's wrong?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
You're gonna get us hung up.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
This is one big mother!
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
You go north, I'll go south.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Darn it!
Think it's still following us?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
It worked!  There they go!
...Where're we goin'?
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Right. You're right.
-- an angel dust dealer --
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
I feel much better now.
-- Eddie...
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
...Jesus!
Murder witness.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I killed the motherfucker.
No. You tell me, Shu.
-- How could I help you?
'lo, Cecil.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
You getting this?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
-- Roger --
And its purpose?
CIA?
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
Albert.
No... No, go away.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
I want you to kill for me.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Get lost Bobby.
I'm nearly out.
What was?
Bobby's got it.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Was there an argument?
You try that you little monkey.
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
How come Jack let's you work here?
Sort of shorthand.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
I don't know, Sam.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
Agent Desmond, it's...
You better dust this place, Sam.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
When?
He probably wanted to drive over.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Do you want to talk?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Where are you going?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Laura, I am your friend.
How did the car get back here?
But I love you, Laura.
Bob.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
We're on our way, Baby.
When he finds out.
What?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
No.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
School?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
What are you doing?
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
...he wants to testify...?
It looks that way.
This is going to drive the ante up.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
They lied.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Thank you. When Debby...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Well, we...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...I made a reservation at...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
I. Yes. It is.
Her doctors killed her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
I understand.
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes.
What did she say?
Yes.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
I object, your Honor...
Overruled...
Why?
I'm a lawyer.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
What happened...?
I've got to work...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I can't guarantee that...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
You know what happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Yeah.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...now who is that...?
...I'm going to need your help...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Are you with me... are you awake...?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...yeah... good...
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
There's nobody left around here now.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
I do know him...slightly.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
We will, sir!
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
You get any sleep last night?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Tomorrow night.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Yeah...how'd you know?
What...happened?
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
You got it.  What's happening?
Then what is he doing?
Me?  Why me?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Now?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
He knows.
I can take it.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Come in.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Believe what?
You okay?
Congratulations.
I just can't believe it.
What's the difference?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Can we talk?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
Jesus.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
How do you know?  They might.
Where are you from any way?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Jesus, you never told them?
Ah... Northeast... sir.
You all right?
So is violating international law.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
What is it we can do for you today?
What's that?
What's that?
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
How would you know?
Trust me donut.  I know.
They tell you that?
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I can't.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
What makes you so sure it was one?
I can't be sure.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
This your car?
You an indian?
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Whattaya mean family?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Why should it?
What is it?
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Sailor... Lula loves you.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Hasta siempre.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
That bastard Pucinski...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
You ain't actin', mama.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
And?
Why, honey?
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
In a fire, as I recall.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
You're scarin' me, baby.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
And no AC.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Oughta make 'em happy.
Sail?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
LULA!!!!
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
No.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
You heard right.
I know... I remember.
She's still a transvestite.
Not Curtis.
Tripp?!
Which is?
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
That was MacCaulay.
Came to my senses.
You peeked, didn't you?
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Her dog, yes.
Who the hell is that?
You're in Kinship?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Can I ask you something about her?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
What'd you tell him?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Maybe she didn't come here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
You're lying.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Yes.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Who's that sitting in your car?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Inside.
And the jacket?
And what did you say?
I know.
Oh?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
Is it good?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
I was thinking of you.
And?
Where you stand?
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
It was a beautiful present.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
No thanks.
What's that?
Aren't you glad?
What are you looking at?
Birds.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
You live around here?
I have to go.
See anything interesting?
Cherry?
They grow outside, don't they?
You knew her?
The passionate one?
Just trying to be helpful.
People have the right to know.
It sounds like you were banished.
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Does he?
What will happen if I do?
The job's okay.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
A diary?
Why not?
That's right.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Then why are you talking about this?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
How long is this going to take?
How do you define it?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
I said I was sorry.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I don't see --
A nap?
Don't ever do that again.
This is garbage!
What else?
You felt pleasure.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
Time.
How do you feel about that?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
They could eat you.
Why do you want to know?
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
What's the problem?
The worst?
Sorry.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
I'm sorry, Walter.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
They seduce you?
What?
I got poked around... here and there.
No you don't.
Not ever?
What?
You're scared.
Just think about it.
Who doesn't?
Thank you.
Sneak up behind me like that.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
She-hit.
Your rig?
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
What about O-2?
Jesus, Lindsey--
Bud, something really important is happening here.
No.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
He's jammed the mechanism.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
Well, that's that.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
No, Bud, no... not you.
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Do we just leave him there?
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
'Fish'?
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
When do you have to go back?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
I'm thirsty.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
And how long will you be away?
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
Nothing... nothing at all!
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Who are you talking to?
And what are we going to do now?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Giulia...
Yes, sir. Three times.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Anything new develop?
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
You really must do me this one favor.
He talked to you Himself?
One of the other Sisters?
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Who told you this?
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
I'm being punished.
I don't know.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
I burnt them.
Why?
It's not that... it's not that...
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know... I don't know...
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
You have a lovely voice.
Oh, yes!
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Why should they?
How were you sick?
From their heads...
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
No.
Do you have any children?
Why not?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Agnes...
No.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Yes.
What?
Doctor Livingston.
To help me.
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Did you want it to come out?
Yes.
I can't tell you that.
What else?
For me to get sick in.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Yes.
I hate him...
It was alive wasn't it?
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Something they... that they overlooked.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
It's your favourite...
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
... Thank you.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
What's your opinion?
That's ridiculous...
And in your eyes?
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
It's possible isn't it?
You hate us don't you?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Yes.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Your niece!
The woman's health is at stake.
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Even Christ would partake socially.
You think she's a saint?
The father!
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Hasn't she had enough?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
Too late for what?
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Y'what?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
I'm a deserter, too.
Yeah.
I've made the scene.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Grotty?
But I won't.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
I beg your pardon?
Get him out of here!!
Have I said something amiss?
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
Should I say it?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
What are we waiting for?
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Something like that.
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
And cunning.
And what do you do about it?
Yes.
Me!
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
That little old man.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
I hope he fell off.
What's he know?
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
No, I'm not.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
My eyes are lighter.
Temper! Temper!
Do I have to raise me voice?
He's been gone a long time.
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
What is he?
Cattle ranch!
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Where the hell are we?
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Dead.
Hurt!  How?
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
No, I don't want us separated.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
It's over, Hunter.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Oh no.
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
We can use the flamethrower.
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
Is it armed?
Receiving.
What'd he say?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Are they close?
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Yeah?
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Any microorganisms?
But?
Find anything we missed?
Oh well... you know me.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
I understand why you did that.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
Which presumably means...
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Better?
It's a rhino.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
How much air-time have I got?
Yeah?
Forget it, man.
Wait.  Lost it.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Jesus.
You should hit the sack, too.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
You're more than modest.
Please do.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
You take charge.
Just like that, eh?
Just like that.
I don't think that's funny.
Aren't you?
You know me better than that.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
I don't know what I take you for anything...
A dull cliche.
Yes, Addison.
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Didn't you know?
Just slipped your mind.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill!
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Many happy returns of the day...
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
I must have frightened her away.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Now don't get carried away-
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
A cowboy.
Why?
Just wondered what?
I just asked a simple question.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
It's only one picture deal.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
Why not?
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
Late for what?
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
Hello, Miss Channing.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
I don't intend to be.
There can't be very much-
Eve... don't cry.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
I think I know...
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Right here.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Ain't it the truth?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
She's just outside the door.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Well...
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Check.
I remember.
Margo, again...
What is?
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute-
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
I'm glad Bill's back.
Who is it? What's it all about?
Where is she?
Who's left out there?
When you do, let me in on it.
How do you mean?
Yes, sir.
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
All you got to do is name it.
I said I'm a dying man!
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
Hey?
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
--what do you think?--
And?--And?--
Anything you've got.
I hate both parties.
Republican?
How do you want to handle Sloan?
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--I know, I know--
How high up, which Republicans?
It's nothing personal, though. 
11:30.
--Howard Hunt?
--Teddy Kennedy?
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
--you got more than one source?--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--there's nothing new in it--
Five hundred; six maybe.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Who were they?
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
What happens when the baby comes?
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Mitchell knew then.
Haldeman too?
Talk about Segretti--
There were more then.
How grand?
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
Government. Recently retired.
Are you sure?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
You can't believe that.
Anything?
--which Young?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
A boy or a girl?
The what to what?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
All right, I got some scotch.
This is your plan, Finch?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Just go!
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Neither will I.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Because I want to.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
That's nice.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Yeah right.
...I've never tried it.
But that one time --
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Of course.
Are you kidding?  No.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
You can send me the address too.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Hey, minuteman.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
Yeah, sure.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Yes.  Seriously.
I told you.
Yeah, bring it on!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
God dammit, Stifler!
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
You want to do it?
That was a great night.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Say that again, Kevin?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
I think you need your balls reattached.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
What?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Claude...?
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Not that I know.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Shit. I feel sick.
Andy!
You fucking liar!
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Saint Severin...
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Well, I don't have any money . . .
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Yes, your highness.
You never thought of the possibility?
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Why does everyone have to act that way?
How do you know?
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do we do now?
What do you mean?
She does.
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
It's an important issue.
What do you mean, next?
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Yes.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
M'm.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Well...
I'll see yuh.
Duane?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Yeah!
Yeah?
It's terrific.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
Oh! Italian, right?
You are extremely sexy.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Were you always funny?
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Yeah?
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Happy birthday.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
That's sick!
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
God, it's so clean out here.
Oh, good. Okay.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Oh!
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
I can't.
Tsch, a few.
Yeah.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
Probably on their first date, right?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Mean?
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Oh.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
You like this house, Max?
His wife has diabetes!
M'mmm.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Absolutely not.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
October-ish.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
He's allergic.
To dander.  Otis.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
That for us?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
The suspense is killing me.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Are you my big hard hero?
A perfect night.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
Did he promise?
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
Ryan's novel.
What?
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Not properly watered.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Yes.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
I know.
What's a sign for that?
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Joking.
Ah.
Elitism?
How long have you been married?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
They're nothing like us.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
You're not serious.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Why?
Ryan!
Oh?
The charades.
That was my clue.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
She's all over him, are you blind?
Fuck you, Panes.
Like your business managers?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Okay.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
Everyday.
Shit!
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Why not?
What did I do?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
I didn't know you had this.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Break's over.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Invisible!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Hlllllllp!
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
You held onto this all that time?
Why do they have you tied up here?
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
ARREST HIM!
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Well, I have some paper towels --
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Twenty-seven.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Sure.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Someone from the office.
His apartment?
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
Was he really upset when you told him?
What for?
Who was that?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
A what?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Where?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I never thought he'd do it.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
This?
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Something like that.
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
How's the patient?
Sure, Doc.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
You got a girl-friend?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
How long has it been -- a month?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
All set for what?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
The nerve.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Where do you live?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Go where?
It's a thought.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I like all of them --
Esprit de corps --
No -- absolutely not --
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Holy shit.
Why they call you that?
Charlie?
Looks that way.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
What'd he say?
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
What cat  ?
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Would he remember you ?
Ours.
This gentleman or myself ?
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
What's your name, sailor ?
Thank you, sir.
What, sir?
The wind --
Change.
No. Walked.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Hairy ?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Go away -- hide yourself.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
And you admired him?
Nah.
That's me.
What is this bridge?
Who are you?
His name is...
Cognac?
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
So that's it.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
She's dead.
Oh.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
How did she..?
Somewhere along the pipeline.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Where's my ELT?
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
Alleged killer.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
Why the smirk?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Oh, please...
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
What needs clearing up?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Stop asking everyone.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
What do you want, Melvin?
What job?
I wasn't asleep!!
Because...
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Can you not be violent?
I've got to sketch you.
What the heck are those for?
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
What?
Did you... do something to him?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Get out.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Thanks.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Another place where?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
What's it mean?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Get on the expressway.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Another contractor.
Right.
Why?
Oh Jesus Jesus...
What do you want to know?
Because I'm done.
He was... taken.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Why not?
But you knew what they were training you for?
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Why?
That's fiction.
No.
Do you think about the game?
Yes.
Breakfast.
Where did you learn it?
Two way?
Transmits and receives.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
We split the money?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
What?
I told you, he will.
Yes.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
Nobody ever sees me.
Why?
Why?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
That doesn't sound normal.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Okay.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Why not?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Taken.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Yep, except a name for this place.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
No....The Asylum!
We're going to need it all.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Let's split.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Am I late?
No, not if you've got better things to do.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
No, We aren't going to do it.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
A fine specimen for conversion.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Did you see anything in the files?
Yeah, somewhere?
Siberia.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
I could pencil you in if you like?
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
No, I love you, really.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
But we could go to London and live in England.
It's not so much.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
I thought I'd help out.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
You will wish you hadn't.
No!
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Just yesterday.
Come on Holly!
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
You are responsible...What has happened?
Have you lost all control of this city?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
With you.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Yeah.
I could take after Dad, too.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Now it's okay?
Don't call him a dipshit.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
-- This play means a lot to me.
No problem --
What is that?
Looking for intelligent life?
In ten words or less?
You don't believe in anything?
The play's in a couple of weeks.
People can see.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
She great or what?
Like fire.
Is there a rush?
We're doing something -- ?
You're sometimes not sure?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Where?
Jamie --
You know how to waltz??
Did you give him a gift?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Dad --
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
This week.
No.
So talk to us about something.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
Yes.
I'm no dummy.
Please.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
For Jefferson High. For books.
You came here to give me my report card?
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
This... is the number one single?
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Hi, Marty.
Hi, Marty!
Oh yeah.
The sunrise? What for?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Maybe if I used my left....
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Who, me?
What year?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Perfect...
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
He said not to tell.
Okay.
Where'd you get them antlers?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Thirty aught six.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
What'd you come out here for?
No.
That's my father. I got to run.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Somebody else is going to get it.
I don't care.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
I don't want a steak.
That's Montana over there.
No.
Really?
Just gimme a chance.
Think I'll take the juice?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Let her out. In my custody.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
Another 'you'?
Never.
Stay here, I'll be back.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
John Whorfin will kill us!
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his �
If you could, I'd �
What are they like? What are they about?
I want to know!
Chet!
...Hello.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
I'm sorry, I just feel like �I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started�
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going � don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Sound a little what?
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Hell, I could tell you some stories�
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
No... Can I come in?
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this�
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
It's okay... It's okay...
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on � just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
I � Mr. Lipnik �
Mr. Lipnik, I �
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
All of which he's now missin'.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
How are you, Nick?
So -- how are things?
How is your -- personal life?
How about the booze?
No.
What was she like?
I need a cigarette.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
Why did you change your name?
Are you arresting me?
Yes, you do.
Didn't you study it in school?
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
How exactly did you hear?
What if I call you Nicky?
No.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
About three months before I met you.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Somebody has to die.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Were there ever any suspects?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Thanks.
I never heard of him.
I went over last night, too.
I'm not afraid of her.
I'm going with you.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You look like dogshit.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Is this finished yet?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Is Jean Michel here?
No.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
What?
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Should there be?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Yeah.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Blue? Where?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
She's good.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Can I walk you home?
Party girls? Can I call you?
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
I'm your family.
I hadn't thought about it.
It looks done.
How is he?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
That's great.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
That one's for you.
I'll make you another one.
'Phillips head,' right?
I didn't know.
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
You're not the Mayor.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
I'm listed.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
Nor I, on the second.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Silent night, violent night...
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Please be looking for me.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
You'd be surprised.
This is easy.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
Mr. Freeze.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
We gotta get those locks changed.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
No!?
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
That's gotta hurt.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
No gun.  How disarming.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
How about dangerous curves?
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
She has an excellent mind.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Why, indeed?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
How are you feeling, young man?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I don't-.
...Not the bat?
What?
Absolutely not.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Who is it?
I'll show you it works.
...You gonna kill me?
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
What are you talking about?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Is this what you wanted?
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
Do you want a drink?
Do you sail?
Maybe we should just kiss.
I don't sing very well.
No one would miss me.
Got it!
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
I've considered that possibility.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
No.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Yeah. Deja vu.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Liar.
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Sort of half.....
Let's get a coffee.
shhh...
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Right first time.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
I beg your pardon?
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
You're not going to ....
Welsh again.
Sure did.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
I am sorry you feel that way.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Ow! These chips suck.
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Huh? Huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
They perk me right up.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
...Two...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Oh no.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Wave at the lion.
Two hours.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
They make gypsies look good.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
She's only fourteen...
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
What...?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Aren't you dead?
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
This is <u>my</u> town.
Handbook?  When...?
About what?
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
Tell the truth.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
Three syllables.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
... I will.
Your qu...?  But you're...
What?
Answer your mother.
They're... not here anymore.
Are they suffering?
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
What's wrong?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Maybe Charles does.
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Their wedding clothes.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
In a day or two, yes.
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Yes, sir.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
May I ask your name?
No. I'm a gardener.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
What is that?
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
I agree.
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I understand.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
What about money?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Good morning, Mr. President.
You heard?
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
... How are the kids getting along?
No, that won't do any good.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
... So what does all that add up to?
Ben!
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Yes, I did.
... Well?
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Well, Ben... I...
Malkovich.
Thank you.
I never played a jewel thief.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Tell your friends.
The ferret?
Right.
I have to go back.
What?
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Tell her you need to see her.
What's that?
You fell in love with her first.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Simulates?
I know. I'm sorry...
Yessir.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Moving story.
Why not?
Who told you?
Somebody told you.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
What's he been in?
Impressions? Those are hard.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
What kind of circumstances?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Ah.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Do you mind?
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You still know.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
YOU HURT ME.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Don't pay to complain.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
I don't. I have my own.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Ya think?
MAMA!
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Might see anything at all at 124.
Better ask Paul D.
The church!
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
What run him off? Tell me that!
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Yeah. Look bad?
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
NUSSING!
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Yeah.
What the fuck is he talking about?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
They were Nazis, Dude?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
And what do you do, sir?
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Huh?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Dieter Hauff?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
What do you do for fun?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
What the fuck are you--
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Huh?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Just for making the hand-off?
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Oh shit.  Walter.
FUCK.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
And the fucking money!
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Huh?
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
No Dude.
There weren't any shots.
Wha.
Wha. . . Donny--
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude here.
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Mind if I smoke a jay?
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Yeah, but--
Walter--
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Blade.
What?
You don't want to go there.
You came back for me.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
He was here.  Watching us.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
What the fuck you doing?
His name is Jared Nomak.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
You shouldn't be here.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Some kind of archive --
You're hurt --
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Is it bad?
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
How could you be a part of this?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
LaMagra --
Blade --
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
What happened to the power?
Trying to find the energy.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Looks like business is booming.
So says her website.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
I don't know. Nightmare.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Oh, Jesus, no--
I know, I know.
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
What? That made her lose the baby?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
Never would've guessed.
No fucking.
Cotter?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--I saw what I saw.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Who?
--who?
I'm not finished.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
403 41st Street, kids: home.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
--it's less than four feet, just--
What's that?
Dad...?
What?
That's why she kills children.
--bullshit--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Domini.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--yes--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
Abby. What's the matter?
No, I--
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Where... where you going?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
...Huh?
Ray?... What time is it?
...You leaving?
Remy.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Sign.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
For the money.
...What kind of fish?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
...Count it if you want.
What's this?
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
What day is it today, Angie?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I've seen a few.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
To your health, Frank.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
What is this? What color is it?
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
He's comin' back?. What for?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
I wanted to see you.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
I . I don't know.
Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
No.
Yes.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
It used to make me laugh .but.
What do you want to do?
Are you a bad boy?
Does that scare you?
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Yes.
I want you to stay with me.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
On a ride.
Nothing.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Am I bothering you?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
So. what's next?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
O.K.
Oh, okay. can I call?
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Shoot.
Jeffrey?. Why?
Where to?
It's okay.
Let's wait for some slow one.
My father has a gun at home.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. no. Why?
Go ahead.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Do you want the car?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
What are watchin' this junk for?
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Should we buy it?
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Murder.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Because I got caught.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Allo?
Diego?  It's George.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Today.
Layaway shmayaway.
Yes, it is.
Money.
Not mad.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
Pablo said no?
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Kristina's fine.
I don't know.
What are you doing here?
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
What do you want from me?
Yeah.
There's schools in California.
But I have a visitor.
Okay, George.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
And you believe the NLF?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
No, and neither were my men.
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
About three hours.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Can you?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- but I can get it for you.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Tell the court about that, please.
How did he look?
About a year and half ago.
We were lovers.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
And how are you now?
She didn't.  She just left.
What kind of information?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
October twenty-seventh.
No.
Yes.
Yes -- he did.
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
No.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Can we get out of here?
Why not?
What do you think?
Nothing.
Hi, Frank.
You and me -- making love.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What are you going you doing?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Yes.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
How bizarre!
Well, there's a problem.
Yeah.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Grateful!?
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Well, I'd like to read them.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Not yet. You want to go?
Not this kind of heat.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Lemon?
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
But I... We don't even know each other.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Listen, I'm sorry I --
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Can I help?
What?
Yes.
Why?
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Why do you say that?
What?
Yes, thanks.
What do you want me to say?
STOP IT!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
But now that you have it -
I'm going to miss you.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
What's her name?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Apparently just before her death.
Then what do you care?
What the hell you talking about?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
We can climb out.
Is this Hell?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
That's some terrible shit.
Looking to score?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
But.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Aren't you going to join us?
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
You were just a kid.
Please...help me...
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
What building?
No way man...
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Yeah, you heard of him?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Evidence of what?
You shouldn't have hit me.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
All right!  Where's the key?
Not bad.  What for?
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Violet, please!
He didn't see you, did he?
No.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What?
What happened to them?
Violet!
Stupid cunt!
Yes, I understand.
You're helping Rajeev?
Another time.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
See?  We're for real.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
I guessed you were straight black.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Oh, I'm sorry --
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Do you know him?
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Basically.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
Even though he knew about you?
Yes.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Yes.
Why?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
What time did you say they would be there?
An accident.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Caesar wants me to stay.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
I don't know.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So it's time to go home.
Who do you think sent me?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Sir, you waited on line.
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
-- sir? --
...I understand...
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Jesus...
Listen to what you want.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Thanks for the ride.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- we'll explain it --
What is that?
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.

What was I thinking, right?
You have ID?
Wait a minute --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
You drink rum?
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ven't you?
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
It's reply paid.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
Her name is Jill.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
If I can help you ...
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Please, I've got to find Jill.
What?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
He's a freelance subversive?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Yes.
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
What?
Well, all wars do -
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
I was right! Step on it!
"And your children all gone."
Go away.
I'm going to open it!
Are you sure?
Don't worry.
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
He is dead.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Here. What do I do next?
You want to take my console into your office?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
What were we saying?
Sam!!! 
What have you done with his body?
My I.D. cards.
But I could be anybody.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Have you got one or haven't you?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Can you fix it?
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
You know each other a long time?
Frank Pierce.
Mary said you might be coming.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Okay, what happened?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
He's dead, huh?
Our Lady of Misery.
He's better.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
She's no whore, Marcus.
What's that, Frank?
No.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Frank!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
What did they do with you?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
Hi.
That's your full name?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Of course.
Watch? --
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Did you bring your grey suit?
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
People phoned in.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Don't go.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Outside?
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Almost immediately.
Jane?
And Bobbie says...
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Because...
No, I don't think so.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Why so glum?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Uh-huh.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Hey?
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
So you like me, huh?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Uh-huh.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
You want to come?
Then you should stay here.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
You're saying stay away from him.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Don't you work here?
A girl with a body like mine?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
You really like it?
What's it called?
Hi Walter.
May I please have another little kiss?
Yes Walter.
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Murdered...man?...
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Walter, what are you doing?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Walter shut up and relax!
Hi.
I thought you didn't respect money!
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Man has a complex.
No, we didn't.
It's coffee.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
You didn't like them.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Let me in.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Hi, Buffy.
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
What'd you dream about?
Hey there.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Hi there.
You want some water or something?
Things are kind of confusing.
Yeah?
For the dance.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
I crashed your party.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
I'm looking for you, actually.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
All right.  What do we do now?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Who we gonna beat?
I had to test you.
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Same one.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Don't start with me again.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Hi.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Hi, Grueller.
Could be.
Got that.
I can't believe they still ate it.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
You're kidding.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
I really was way way too too.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Nuke?!
Just till I lose.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
You should be at the game.
I'm Crash Davis.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Yep.
Damn.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
What's so great about baseball?
It's possible.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
God bless you.
What's that?
I didn't spit on you!
How?
Naw...
Can I ask you something?
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
What?
Fear and ignorance.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
She's playing with my mind.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
We're eight and sixteen.
Eight and twenty-four.
It's a miracle.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
What'you want, kid?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
What?
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
Hi, Ace.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
But what happens when they do find out?
I'm serious. No interference.
Excuse me.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
She's not here, Sam.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
I don't know.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Somethin', huh?
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
Ohh!
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
In so many words, yes.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Yeah?
Yes, you lost your control.
Yeah.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
That's right, yeah.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Meet me at three.
What people?
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
I-I'll do it.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You all right?
Okay.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Oh, fabulous.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Okay, okay.
Hello.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
He wanted a watch, too.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
The arrangement is over!
I put her to bed.
With Jennifer.
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Why do you want to do that?
You fuckin' whore!
Loose machines are right back over there.
Yeah.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Yeah, that works out.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Hi. Good.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Hey.
Can I go in?
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
For what?
What're you gonna do?
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Hm.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
All right?
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
You know?
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Is that what you want?
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
You are.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Here.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
There's more!
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Get up.
She asleep?
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
He's here.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Fuck you!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
How you doin'?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Again!
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.

No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
You're probably right.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Wha-at?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Pass!
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
How much?
What did--?
What?
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Where do you think you're going?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
Lady, don't let him do it!
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
Make a "U" and go back.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
My name is --
Oh won't I?
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
That makes two of us.
Does she wear glasses?
What's happening?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
It's locked.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
There isn't any such person.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You could've hit me.
You wouldn't --
What's Nels' number?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
That's a reasonable possibility.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Sure.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
Stay there.
It's your call.
I don't know what you mean.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I suppose you're in your taxi?
How far off are you?
Where do I turn?
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Let me talk to the lady again.
I already called for an ambulance.
Scottish?
He's what she should run a mile from.
What would you call it?
Good thing in a man.
Sure, Dave --
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Not in my experience.
Scottish?
You on the game?
What look?
Would you like a drink?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
He was different.
What do you think?
You mean that?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
You mean that?
Made me feel all funny inside.
I didn't mean to hit you.
So I'm sorry.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Details, baby, details.
Sorry.
Am I becoming repetitious?
No. Can't pretend that much.
Happy now?
Dil, this is Jude.
What you doing, Jimmy?
I'm not sure.
You'd do anything for me?
Don't call me that --
Why?
You heard what I said, Dil?
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Tell me you love me.
Say it again.
Do I?
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Yes.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
You sure?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
So it was you all the time.
Should blow you away, you know that?
Definitely unusual.
I seen your fucking face.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No. It's the truth.
What makes you think that?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
You make a nice couple.
Why?
See? I was right about you.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
It's as simple as that?
Help me.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Don't run off, Jude.
All right -- where's the letter?
What are you talking about?
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Let's look anyway.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Reggie -- stop!
You lied to me so many times --
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
You mean spies and things like that?
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Agent.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
But --
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Barely, yes.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Me?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Why you lied to me.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Cutting it out.
What day is it?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
What's so illogical about that?
What -- like Scobie?
No sense messing up the streets.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Shut the door!
It's a start, anyway.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Mrs. Lampert --
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
He was American?
I don't know.
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elys�es"  Why there?
Up there! It is up there!
Peter Joshua.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
I'm not sure I --
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Now you're angry.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Doing what?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
What's he up to?
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I never fucked Rod.
One more time.
Good.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
You said that two weeks ago.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
How much further?
It was a she.
You know her?
Is Jody still awake?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
What do you know about my father?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
He says he loves me.
No!
I promised I'd go right home after school.
FINE. Are you?
What party?
You can't tell your parents.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
You heard about that?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
I do not.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
That's not why we broke up.
Yes?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Who is she?
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You didn't believe her?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yes.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Unfair?!
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.

...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Why don't I--?
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
...and a shitload of ice.
...-tana.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!

I'm gonna stomp your a--
...up.
Come on!
...all the time.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
Am I missing somethin' here?
Borrowed.
That's...

    Elvis is on ice again.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...Shift.

I don't think we have much of a choice...
 Okay.
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
...Pete.  Come on.
Shut up!

 Shit. 
 Go on.

Taking it down the hill.



What?
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
You're fucked, man.
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...truck.
 Yeah.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
Not completely, anyway.
...shit.
...miles.
 Whoo!
I think you oughta cut a...
A-And you  owe me...
They're movin'.
Reach into my pocket.
 Okay.
Okay, here we go.
 That's why I didn't give it...

Stop.

...on!
We!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
 What's it say? 
Forty-nine point four.

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!

Sorry.

 Well.

Stop limpin' around like that.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Us.  Owes us.
I think so too.
Thank you.
We're worried...

Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
...take my sorry old truck.
I had no idea how powerful it was.

You-You can't let him...
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Exactly.

Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
...-bility.
You'll kill us all!
...about--
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
"Went away."  I like that.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
This is it.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Hit him.
Hit him again.

Vaughn.
Check the immediate area.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Shit.
Dennis!
...noon.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
Odd, then, that his car...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
I want you to look at one another...
...to die for a country that's...

No.
Where's Elvis?!

...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...he's smart enough to get you...
There's something else too.

Video lock.
What's going on, colonel?
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
Where are you now...
...tunnel!
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...hands!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
 Listen, Pappas...
Just go check the temperature.
Yeah, I'm sure.


 Talk to me.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Honest?
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
At my age, you tend to lose track...
Avocado groves?
She's fine.
What does this mean?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Off the alley.
You sure this is okay?
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
I've been wanting to meet you.
How are you, Lou?
I'd like to talk to him.
Didn't you call?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
What are you talking about?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
No.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Why?
K... Cross.
Yes... why?
No. I'm just a snoop.
How did it happen?
Then it was over the water department.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
I'll stay.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
It was in Chinatown.
What did he say?  What did he say?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
She's not tied up!
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Going somewhere?
What did you do that for?
No...
How do you know?
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
The obituary column?
Ida Sessions.
Oh, good.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Never?
Never.
The water.
The L.A. River?
Yeah?... I do?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
They were partners.
This?
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Yeah?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
What's that, pal?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
Course, she settled down nicely.
Will they really find work in Germany?
How's school?
Why? What do you mean?
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Did you ever see her again? 
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi. Why are you running?
We'll talk about that later.
So what'd they say?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
No...
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
Three cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
It didn't end very well, did it?
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
Oh yes, there is.
What's funny now?
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
You're very easily amused.
Yes -
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Susan, I really think -
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Yes?
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
Are you finished?
What check?
What's this?
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Was he in love?
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Thompson!
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
What about that apartment?
Hey, now wait a sec...
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
Can I join in?
So where is he?
Can I use the bathroom?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Am I missing something here?
He was?
When did you get back?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
And you said yes?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
I'm giving him his ring back.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
You have a better suggestion?
What about Sing?
Sang.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Nobody. It was closed.
Who are you to make assessments?
Like you're better!
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Five years.
She called you Brad?
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
All four?
You know what I just watched?
What's that?
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Yeah.
There's more?
And the second time around...?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
What's he looking for?
Nudie booth?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
What kind of show?
Can we talk about this later?
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
I'm going to miss the game.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Exactly. They drank it all.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
She meant nothing to you!
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
You were saying?
Stop it.
He made it, hunhh?
Reach what?
I can't fucking believe you!!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Holy shit. That girl?
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I should shit or get off the pot.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
To say the least.
Yes.
Do I know you?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Veronica.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Yeah, but...
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Really?
Oh, you think so?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Something wrong?
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Why do you call him that?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
He gets off on it.
You sucked his dick!
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Let it go...
I love you. Don't feel sick.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
Sure.
Would you let me explain...
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Veronica, I love you...
No way!
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
To an Asian design major.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
And... he told you all of this?
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
Like hell you are!
Twenty bucks?
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Answer the man.
I don't know.
I copy.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
There wasn't time for anything else.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
He knows it well.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Hello, Gabriel.
I don't think you do.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't expect you to understand.
Why are you yelling?
From one professional to another, of course.
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Gabe...your arm?
Yeah?
Nice view, huh?
Can you see light?
Reach up!  Do it!
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Yeah...
What's your names?
Have her come up.
Where's the rest of the team?
Right.
I don't know about totally.
What's the delay?
Why?  What are you going to do?!
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Won't you join me, sir?
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Yes. They want to help.
Help me, sir?
Who are they, sir?
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Hullo.
Alex.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
It's alright, thank you.
I beg your pardon?
Do you still feel suicidal?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Helping you, sir?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Let me get up.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Fine... fine.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Fine. Fine.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
How many to a cell?
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
Max...
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Something going on?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
What's he sayin'?
I'm standing right here.
You're kidding me.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Yeah?
...why is everything always about you...
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
Max.
What about that?
It's a mess.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I need the job.
Another collateral.
Let's go.
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
What, no insurance?
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Why?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
You're full of shit.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I never told her.
Why the hell not?
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Do you still ride?
You going to warn him?
You think I'm crazy.
Them who?
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
Can you prove any of this?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
What are you doing?
So what's the question?
Not this again.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
Okay, I will.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Where are we going, Jerry?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Did you kill him?
Love at first sight?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You've asked me that one three times.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Excuse me?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Yeah, I do.
Where do you think Jerry is?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
What?
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
So?
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Peter sends his regards.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
What?  Why?
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
What?
J39 Z186...?
It's beautiful.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
You're not real.  None of this is.
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
And in return?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Hokkaido Island.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
It's really happening.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Do you love your parents?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
If you came back.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
Ellie --
The final countdown.
What...?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Hi.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
I'll make it a dollar.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Yeah.
What are you doin' here?
Yeah.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Git to work!
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
Luke. Where you goin?
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Cuter again.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Back a buck.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
What are you talking about?
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
You know where.
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Would you want to work with us on this?
How do you know that?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
Halloran.
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
I'll get a locksmith.
Is there a phone booth there?
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
I was.
Michael Johnson.
I like women like that!
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Where you going?
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
How'd you get in on the deal?
Or the F.B.I.?
It's about time.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
You're not envious?
I thought that was you, up there.
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Hard to say.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Then, you should call.
Just go ahead and tell us.
Hi, Mom.
How can I help?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Oh no.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Which flowers did you order?
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Honestly, Letty.
I'm really not that hungry.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
A small price.
We're supposed to be asleep.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
What else would you do?
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I have a terrible confession.
Tell the doctor.
Then it's over.
I better make a list.
I love the pillows.
Michael.
This must be Beast.
You got wine. That's great.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
The restaurant, too?
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Silly?   Silly am I?
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
And all the plans we have.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
You can get out of the dinner.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
Especially this last year.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
You what?
I've met someone else.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Getting back.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
I'm glad you're doing well.
How's it look?
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Someone else coming?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bring me the scissors.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
How much?
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
-- Did you set it up?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
What'd they take?
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
What hotel?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
This kind.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I'm not going to leave you.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
-- I want to be Elvis.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
It's good.
God, I want to go home.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Give it to me, Sami.
How?
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
When do we go?
Frankie, I --
She seems pleasant enough.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
Don't bother.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Go.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
No.
Then, why did you come?
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
She needs direction... and training.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Talent. Hi.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You're welcome.
Mister Funboy lives there?
No.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Miss her?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Thank you.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
You didn't show it to anybody?
Nothing.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
From who?
You promise not to say anything?
No.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Why are you being so dramatic?
What'cha reading?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Need a lift?
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
You don't even know me.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
What?
Need any company?
You must take me for a real idiot.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Yes.
Where are you going?
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
But you knew this was important to me.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Where did you say she's from?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
The football stud?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
What are the boys like?
Eww. No. That's gross.
Are you for real?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Why didn't you do something?
Well did you like it?
That's one way of looking at it.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
Call me later.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
You amaze me.
What's your problem?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
With who?
Where'd she go?
Oh yes.
Some other time.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Ronald? That's crazy.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
She's out.
Do you know when she'll be back?
I'll do that.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
What are you talking about?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
I think I should.  3000W?
Something's haywire,
Well, it seemed to me --
What?
That's the Farren house.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
I live right here.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Yes, I did.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
It was on account of the birthday party.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
I've wanted a friend.
But where do you come from?
I can not tell you.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
That's right!
Yes, Amy.
Look at my ring.
A lady threw it to me.
I wasn't singing to myself.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
Mommy read it to ne.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
What does that have to do with me?
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
I don't know.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
What did he say?
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
So where's this infamous arm now?
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
No.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Peter keeps asking me out.
Guess she never found true love.
What choice do we have?
I'm cleaning my stove.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
I know.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
This really isn't a good time.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
My mom used to get PMS too.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Like what?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
Briefs.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
They do? Oh no...
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I think I'm a werewolf.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You can't believe this bullshit.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
What makes her think that?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasn�t this his case?
I didn�t requisition a secretary.
I�m sorry...
Who is it?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
People...  after me.
What?
Where does it lead?
Then we must call the police.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Dave...
The Washington Post.
Clean.
Clean.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's a homeless shelter.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
At a press conference.
Dave!
What?
Perceptual?
Why?
They re not my attack dogs.
Really?
Your government needs your help.
I can't say.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
What are you staring at?
Anybody would have done it.
Where are you going?
You1re leaving, too?
How were you gonna get home?
Well I guess...
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Hi.
Hi.
I know.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
Quiet!
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
What is it?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
We got a boat.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
What'dya get?
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
I don't think they're in school.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
So you really think she means you're going with her?
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
What?
No.
What good will that do?
This is stupid.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
A yawp?
Yawp!
Again!  Louder!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
What is this, a midnight study group?
What is that supposed to mean?
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Who are you?
He's the owner...
Who?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
We were talking about my schedule...
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Where are my men?
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Noooo!
What are those things?
Quite a few.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Anti social?
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
I don't know where it is!
It's not them...it's it...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Someone's back there.
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
Yes, Albert?
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Tell him, Vince!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
She does not!
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
You like to call me Linda now?
Get anything?
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Linda...
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
What?
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
You're going hunting?
C'mon. I've got the car.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I just wait. You know?
Yeah.
Promise! You gotta promise!
What else?
What do you think?
Forget Sal.
How many bullets?
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Then lemme have 'em.
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Where?
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Yeah.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
That's who.
Naw.  Uh-huh.
Never one.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
What did you say?
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Hello Wade.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
Kill him... kill him.
Just great.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
They're going to rob that bank.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
Why?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
What's this place?
You need anything else?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
What else did he get?
How do I look?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You should be in hospital.
Demolition Man.
They always are.
Seat's too high.
What's your name?
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
Belle --
I didn't.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Sure am.
Stevens!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Opportunities?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
I don't care.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
But -- I was just lucky.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Well -- yes --
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Why not -- ?
Jabez -- help!
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
But I'm glad to be home again --
There is nothing to worry about now.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
I'll get it, Jabez.
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Consarn the consarn --
Hard luck -- like me.
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
I dunno.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
I want you to fix these fish!
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
You aren't angry with me?
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Jabez ...
Hullooo!
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
It's okay, it's okay.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
What's happening?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
New York...
Put it down now.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Encourage them to be bolder.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
How do you know?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Heidi, I'm dying.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Hey, don't take the car!
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Yeah.  So how are you?
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
What am I supposed to do?
Denmark?  Sweden?
I know I am.  I know!
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
How many you got in there?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Sonny, be reasonable!
Okay, what do you give me?
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
He's all doped up.
I want to talk to him.
We're all set at Kennedy.
I must of been outta my mind.
Now, you -- what's your name?
Well, they go to guard school.
You like me?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
No, not until after they killed him.
Did you always call him Junior.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
Dead or alive?

What kind of a deal?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
I'm here.
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
I am.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Oh my God, mother!
This is Drake Bishop.
Where are we going?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
What?
<i>What happened to them?</i>
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Is that you, Domino?
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
Can you tell?
What did he say about the arm?
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
We're covered on legal with that, right?
How you be?
I be.  I'm living large.
I don't like anything else.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
Did you ask Sal?
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
What?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
It's been about a year.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Eddie Lovell.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Wake up!
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
I'm coming.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
It's a fucking shame.
ML?
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Sal, can you do me a favor?
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Do we now?
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
Tina, you are too slick.
Where's the ice cream?  The H�agen- Dazs butter pecan?
I can't be staying long anyway.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Shaddup, Vito.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Magic Johnson.
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
Yeah.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
Get the broom.
How do you know this?
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Then we could try something else.
I didn't think so.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
But I came here to learn about America.
Four colors? Neato!
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Ooh gross.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
The second R is silent.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
She did not.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
HARRY.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
You're it.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Who's your partner?
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Some what?
You have beautiful eyes.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
Guys, this is much better.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
I'm not sure if I can do this.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
You said "aloha" twice.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
What?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
What's that you're saying?
We felt his presence.
Don't touch my mother...
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Man-carved steps.
Liet?
Did they try and fail?
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
It is my home.
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Why were you buying a coffin?
Don't you bave a car?
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Do you want me to get it for you?
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Bela, what happened?!
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Um, okay... roll camera
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
It's a damn good role.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Goddamn landlord.
I told you this was gonna happen.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
You're a fuckin' mess.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
You could say that --
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Could we moovf to table?
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
My eyes are killink me.
What is happening?
Yes?
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Lugosi?
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
The marriage already ended.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
What's uncanny?
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
No! Do they show you having sex?
Al!
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You know what would be great?
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
Ed --
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Yes?
Thank you. Can I see her?
What?
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
When? Today?
Hey, he cheated on her.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Who?
What?
But Al is your husband now!
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
How much less?
You batted or you bunted?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Yeah...
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Oh God, this is so weird.
What are you doing?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
The what?
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I know, I ...
... yeah, then, but...
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
It's not their fault.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Polish acrobat.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
... Ray?
Good-bye, brother!
Come on, Ma.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
Check forging.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Mm.
How?
pierdes.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
How'd it go?
What?
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
Larry?
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
NO, that's fine
Thanks for everything.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Why are you lecturing me?
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Yes?
What do you mean?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Hmm?
Which door?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Who put you up to this?
You dumbshit!
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Till 19-fucking-70.
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
I want to know about Exley.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Lad, may I have a word with you?
This business, Captain?
Captain, what do you want?
Dudley, what do you want?
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
You know him?
Lynn.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
At least not anymore.
Ellis Loew.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
What little studio?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Man, what're you saying?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Gone.  Not a trace.
And?
Dudley, we've been over this.
No.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
What's this all about, lad?
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
She is Lana Turner.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
What's on the call sheet?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I'll take your word for it.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Where will you go?
When?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
I just called it.
Have we met before?
What happened?
DePinto's dead.
Nothing.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Listen--
I'm doing a transfer now.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Really?
You're crazy.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What'd I tell you?
<u>Here</u>?!
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
What the fuck?!
Fuckin-A.
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
What are you saying?
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
The robbery.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Did he give you anything?
To buy lingerie.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Does that hurt?
Good.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
It tastes like fish.
DePinto?
He doesn't work that way.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You got a minute?
Who's doing this?
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Who would do that?
Some of 'em.
Where've you been?
They didn't take the silverware?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
I don't know. I mean--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
I have a family.
It's been a few years.
The police?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
Fuck you.
What?
What happened?
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
We believe?
Yes sir.
Yes?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it�
Daskylus�
Hello!  Good morning.
Excuse me?
I don't want to go back.
I'd like you to have them.
What am I looking at?
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Good.
You sew very badly.
Now.
What?  No!
Would you let me pass?
Don't do this.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Dance with me.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Right.
I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Okay.
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Is this you?
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in�have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
I don't know what that means.
Where did you find that?
Well, then ask him his name!
Are you planning to be the exception?
Irving Berlin.
Top Hat.
Me?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
That's a different dress.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Of course.  When?
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
No.  He's - no.
Does he have to go?
A bit of one.
I had a hotel room.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Katharine!
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
Through a window.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
You ordering chop suey again?
That's doable.
We're getting close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
You're not taking me seriously.
I know.
It's a test.
You stole my luggage? You--
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Someone was expecting that.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Got it.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Yes. Yes.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
What?
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
What about the rules?
There's always a surprise.
Charged.
It was wrong to deceive you.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
Four billion dollars.
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
No way.
--You're a cop.
You gave them the eight billion.
In the van.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
You two make quite a couple.
Suspicious, after all these years?
She's calling the shots now.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Cause of the chromium.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a r�sum�, make an --
Yeah?
All I have is hundreds.
Out to lunch with the girls.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
What are you doing here?
Oh, yeah?
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
Course I did.
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
I don't get why they'd do that.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
What's a demur?
Counts?
She insulted me!
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Uh-huh.
Fuck Kurt.
Morning!
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Who's the judge?
And you were told to destroy those?
I don't know what you're talking about.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
What's going on in there?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Which number do you want, George?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
What're you doing?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
Thinking.
About this.
More than you need me.
You already packed up your stuff?
Hello?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
Yes?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
He'll learn.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
That's right.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Are you crazy!
No lightspeed?
Can you trust him?
I don't like this.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
About what?
Are you kidding?
I always said you were a gentleman.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
No.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
What about Han?
Someone's falling.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Where are you going?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
With food?
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Primitive?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
I tried...
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
Oh Cuervo...
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Shit.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
I'm already dead.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
What's the little black box do?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
A medical team will be standing by.
I'm here.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Does he know how to activate it?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
How do we get out of here?
You're running out of time.
All of us?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Perceval, you have returned!
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
I left it in the tent, sir.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
No.
You.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Dinner at the White House.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
What did the doctor say?
What is it?
Phonograph.
Oh, I see.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
And those lies she's been telling?
Lies?
Convulsion?
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Are you sure?
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Please go away.
That depends.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Um........Stuff.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Cause I like it.
Yeah
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Well I heard differently.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
St. Mike's.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get it then?
Lieutenant?
She seemed fine.
What's playing.
Intensely.
It would bring us together.
What's that?
Save your servant
Her heart.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
That's to bad.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
Miss?
Are you a relative?
I don't know.
Frankie.
We have some lotion.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Jack.
Jack...
So we on tomorrow night?
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
You gotta go.
What do you mean?
What're you talking about?
Sure, why not.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
You all right?
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
He's drunk.
No, you take the right.
Yeah.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
What?
Really.
Fine.
She's a big girl.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
What are you talking about?
The Royal.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
They were simple songs.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Be reasonable, Jack.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Jack!
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
I'll take the Mallory.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
So what'd you think?
You sure?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Actually, that's my stage name.
This is where the auditions were.
We ran long.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
We're a team.  We work together.
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
That!  You can't wear that!
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Great?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Born and bred.
Funny hours.
Regular hours are eight to five.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Yeah.
It went well tonight.
Is that the way it is?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
It's okay.  Last one.
I can keep the beat.
Nothing.
Friend.
Jack.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
What are they?
Huh? Oh, no.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
... I was dreaming ...
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
Now what?
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Pollux is -- what?
What are you -- stupid?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
That's your name, isn't it?
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
What's that?
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
You always say that -- then you leave.
-- what?
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
You?  Married?
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Well, Alan, I think we�re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
And I know people.
What about me?
What�s going on here?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Don�t you think that�s a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
We�re friends, aren�t we?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn�t the life I dreamt about.  Where�s the romance, where�s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can�t have...
She said that?
It�s me, Jack...
C�mon Jack...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
No?  C�mon, Jack...I�ve got everything I need, I don�t have regrets, that�s just not for me... sound familiar?
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
It�s lovely...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Frank.  Where�s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Look, I don�t know what�s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
About the plane? What do you think it�s gonna crash? Don�t say that...
What kind of man does that!?
Because that�s where I live.
Why not?
You�re kidding me...
But it�s twenty degrees outside...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Well...Annie for one.
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Jack.
I�m out of the doghouse?
Don�t do that...
I promise, Jack...
Please. Let�s just go have a cup of coffee. That�s all I�m asking for. I�m sure there�s another flight to Paris tonight.
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I�ll be fine...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Hey, are you okay?
I'd like that, too.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
I found it!
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Are you alright?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
How bad off is he?
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
And take a little trip with them...
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Listen...the Heart.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
He's making a fine recovery.
Shouldn't you answer that?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
You have no right to blame Duval --
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
Any reserve air?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
The Wall's transparent...
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
This is a new car, then, sir?
What's this, sir?
I don't think so. It's nice.
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Clear him off the road.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's right. And we need more money.
We need more -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
Yah, okay, but, uh -
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Oh sure.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Where you girls from?
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Yah.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Uh-huh.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
You bet.
Yah.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Yah, real good.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
My patience is at an end.
...Is everything okay?
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
The heck d'ya mean?
Yah?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
...Geez.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
No, that's okay.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Geez! You look great!
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
I'm sorry, Mike.
...Hello?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
What'd he say?
Linda.
No.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
We've got a -
Whose car?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
No, no.
It's terrific!
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
Cornelius!  How are you?
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
You need to lighten up.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I found a new one.
What... ?
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Here.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
... A person.
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
What is wrong with you?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
What?
You are an insane person.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
How have you been?
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
This is how I met --
I mean -- for a living.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
There's always that.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
What list?
No, I...
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
What?
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
No thanks, I quit.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What... ?
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
What are you doing?!
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
What the hell ... ?!
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
I want to hear the truth.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
You... you can't be serious about this.
Stop finishing...
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
You need me.
... no, no, no...
Why are you doing this?!
What have you left for me?
Do something for me.
Look at me...
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Really?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
You're welcome to join our club.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
What list?
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Should we knock?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
That lucky bastard.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
I've got to stop and help those people.
Maybe.  What's this about?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Kalarjian?
Sure.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I'm... really sorry.
4:25.
Fag.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Yeah.  Why not?
You okay?
What's this?
What's she saying?
American?
That guy's not going to make it.
You're gonna love it.
I thought he was with you.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
That's an order.
You pathetic scum.
What's the job?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
What?
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Fine.
Meeting ... people.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Really?
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
And who's Lydia?
See, I told you!
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Where?  Maybe we can.
I was nine in the sixties.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
A list.
Free?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Parry.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
Who are you talking to Jack?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
In a bar called Hellfire.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
No just Parry.
It sounds exciting.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Is it my turn again?
You're the pathetic one, not me.
Who said I was depressed?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Okay, Ray...
Just finish eating.
Come on.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
What?
You're leaving?
Swimming?
You don't call that music, though.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
That's what you said?
What?
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Yes.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
I hope I didn't hear that.
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Of course.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
So wadda you do with your girls?
So what you think of me?
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
I gotta go take a piss.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
You gonna talk to him?
You looking for somebody?
Who?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
You sure?
I know how ta get him back if you want.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Fletch F. Fletch
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
What the hell are you doing here?
We play tennis at the club.
Mrs. Smith.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Jesus.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Here you are, Doctor.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
You may be right.
Cash. I'm impressed.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
I'm the Sufi.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Yeah. Maybe.
Because we can't.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Did you hear something?
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
His bride. Cute as a button.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
No wonder.
What?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
I want something I can print!
But I ain't got you...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Have what?
Did she tell you anything?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
All your friends call you Jazz.
You wish.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
You okay?
What an interface!
How much?
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
It's red, Ford.
Zuzu, wake up...
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
I can't kill this kid's father...
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
Did he just say what I think he said?
You need it.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Who's my real father, man?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Fine!
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
Doyle.
Where are you?
Well try, okay?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Tu sais j'ai r�fl�chi longuement � ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-m�me.  Tiens.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
We must follow it.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
Yeh?  Who else?
Where's he from?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Never trust a nigger.
Who is that guy?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
Hiya, Jesus.
Pass.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Damn.
Butch called.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
I swear, Satch.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Next time lets put some money on it.
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
What?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
How could this be happening?
You sound...ground up...?
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
No, not yet.
I lost you.
Tell me.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
When?
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Yeah, I think so...
It's not your fault, Dad.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
What's wrong?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Go in where?
Longbranch...?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She makes ten.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
What?
He ain't our guy, John.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Nah, just working the job.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
What're you gonna do?
Think you can figure it out?
It's dark down there.
What's this?
Is that so bad?
Somebody was in here.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
Yes.
What're you doing?
Bullseye!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I just want you to like me.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Look --
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Okay.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
He bought you that?
A major prick.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Time to check out the waiters.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
And you'll never do it again.
What's that?
Jason's here in New York.
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
Did you find Rennie?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Everything okay?
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
I didn't mean for you to go!
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Alla puttanesca.
Press a button and they give us money.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
That's awful.
Where are you going?
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
This could be it.
I talked to her two days ago.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
Why do you need a radio?
That's completely crazy.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
I have a class. I'm late.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What else?
What else?
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
See, Daddy.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
I am really, deeply sorry.
Life is good.
A thousand things.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
I want to believe.
Life is good.
Then they lost?
Yes.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Home.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
In England, I was a poor student but I --
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
There are a few million miles to go yet.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Er, no...
How much extra?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
That's the last.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Often.
Suit yourself.
German.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
What are you talking about?
You really had other offers?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
How was your evening?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Will you be okay?
Thank you.
What do you think?
Vincent...Vincent...
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
You worried about the cost?
Not that.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
What's this, Lamar?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
How's Estelle?
Boring.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
After four years and now the question comes up.
I couldn't have... much longer.
That doesn't hurt.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
She's on TV.
And switched keys.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Texas is a big state.
When we had trouble before it was different.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
You and me.
I don't know.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
What now?
No, I'm afraid not.
Where?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Wire pull over?
How's Mama and the kids?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
That's what I want.
How long have you been married?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
What did you do?  Albert?
Nothing. What could I do?
You knew what I'd do.
Well, he drove it into the river.
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
I know.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Jack?
I can't Jack. How can I?
Everyhing go off all right?
She's nothing to do with me.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
I want to talk to you later.
He was all right to me.
Why'd you see him so regular?
I call that regular.
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Is he coming here?
I want to give you an Oscar.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Now tell me the truth.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Nice of you to come.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
You work here, Keith?
I won't be using the room tonight.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
And what you going to do?
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
What's that supposed to mean?
What you going to do?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Yeah.
I have to. Things to see to.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Not suede boots!
Knock it off, Gerald.
Three hundred altogether?
Four hundred?
You're not seeing me?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
What?
Just the act.
You build it!
When they...
Yes...?
Someone should hurt them.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
Talking about it as a...
Did you?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Is that what I said?
You're saying "me."
I'm sorry?
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Yeah.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Thieves.
They're inured to it.
Where did Moss...?  I...
The leads come in, I'll let...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
Then put me on the board.
I'm not sure I have two.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
Is that what you're saying?
Get 'em to me!
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Well, hadn't it?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
Why?
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
Fuck you, Dave...
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
Oh, Christ.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Which...
You're sure?
No, his wife is.
Kenilworth.
Ricky, I...
Yes.
What do I...?
Three days.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
What is?
You tell me again.
No.  She told me "right now."
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
I...
You hear what I said?
Guess who?
We haven't got a lead...
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
Three.
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I saw him with you.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
You know otherwise, Freddie?
We have time.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
He's an Italian?
 And he agreed?
The 'patrone' is here.
I'm going to see my parents.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Where's my brother?
Go on, tell me.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
No strings.
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
You would have killed his brother?
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
You're a considerate young man.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
What about Michael Corleone?
How much more a month?
It never crossed your mind?
You liked it too.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Just that I was in the Marines.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
But why?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
Is this David's doing?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
So you had a wife?
What way might that be?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Not at the moment.
Why not?
You're talking through your hat now.
You were a soldier?
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
No.  The girl.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
A very lucky thing indeed.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
I don't remember that one.
No.  It won't do.
You are much too human.
I don't know.
I'm up.  Thanks.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
She is horrible.
Does the yardman come today?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
What rumors might those be?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
What kind of job... ?
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
How is he?
You have my word...
And this has what to do with me?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
What's wrong with it -- ?
Where you been, anyway?
C'mon, man ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
What about him?
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Oh, for God's sake
Any more, O -- ?
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Any more ...
Yeah ...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Nah. It's a scratch.
Hey, now -
I can handle it --
You?
You don't think so, huh?
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
You okay -- ?
Nah.
You want me to buy her?
What for -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Call 'em here -- ?
What's with the look?
On account of Mitch?
A distinction worth noting ...
And you got some Italians -- ?
She's trouble --
That what you want?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Slip it in ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
What are you doing... ?
What's that?
You remember Junie?
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
You need him...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
What do you want, shithead?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
What are you doing here, assface?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
What are you talking about?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
We've got to help each other.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Yeah.
He heard.
You ready?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
The third store down.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Oh shit.
What'd you get? You get leniency?
It's a way outta here.
You don't know that.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Good, it was all right.
And what do you see?
What is it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Yes. Under two conditions.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
Okay. How?
What's that?
Shall we start the, uh...
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Yes.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
I'll be okay.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
Now wait a minute--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
"Undermine?"
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
There is somebody...
Well, she out did herself today...
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Have you read all these books, Will?
Yeah, I read those.
What did you think?
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
--Well, maybe that means you.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
Gerry says the meeting went well.
What?
Define that.
I didn't want the job.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
You're Welcome, Will.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I'm Will.
What?
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
No.
No I haven't...
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Not far from here, South Boston.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Some, a little.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
So, do you play the piano?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Yeah.
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
I'd come back--
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
What'd he look like again?
Women?
Say, who runs this place?
Why ain't they more like it?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Crate fell on me.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
Is it fur?
They're all gone--or dead.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
I aim to.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
How 'bout Granma?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No plants.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
Look, Ma!
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
They know what--this fella looks like?
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
I could hide you, Tommy.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Sure. Good-by.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Here we go!
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
I wisht it was day.
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Morning.
Yes, sir.
You do not.
You're so funny...
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Computer guy.
Remember high school?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Are you going to the reunion?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Watched television?
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
...Let me get my coat.
No time.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Lisbon?
This?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
He didn't.
They blame you for the compromise.
They were very upset.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
That's wonderful, Mom.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
I have to get my head back into my work.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
I'm a professional killer.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
You okay?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
What's that to miss?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Everything under control?
Annie!
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Mom?
Would you like to see that?
You buckled up?  You cold?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
He's still sitting in that damn field.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Who is it?
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Let's bring your bags inside.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
I'm sorry.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
Doing what?
What did he say?
What was I saying?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I know. We miss you too.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
What do you mean?
You want to take a walk with me?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Where does this go, Diane?
What was it like?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
You don't seem to upset?
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Promise?
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
I don't believe they'll expect that.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
What does that mean?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
You want to watch some television?
I know. Amazing.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Right.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
That's far out!
Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
Dead.
Dade?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
How was school?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Yes!
That's a nice score for a girl.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Yeah.
And if I win?
Make it our first date.
We need your help.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
I can't believe they decided you won.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Colonel who?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
So?
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
So?
Who's that?
Not without Jamie.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady! Come with us.
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Its too late.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Watch it.
Night Doc.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
I don't want to.
Double scoops?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
You knew. You just didn't care.
You won't look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
I don't know.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Right here, Ben.
He's here, Sheriff.
Its true, Sheriff.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Now you understand?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Look where?
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
He can still watch.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
They could be.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Is Annie around?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
There WAS.
Promise?
I promise.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
I killed him...
Laurie, you come with us...
Hello.
She's washing her clothes.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Ever done anything like this before?
Mmm?
I love that.  That's my type.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
It's French, though.  It really is.
And you, you-you're going?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
We could...we could do that.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Well, are...are they big?
Ed Smythe, yes.
Oh, Elliot!
How about you?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Uh, yes!
Yes.
I'm...all right.
Well, sure.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Elliot!
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
No.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Mm-hm?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
You bet.
Was I?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Why not?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Absolutely.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Because I have to!
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
I'm saying it now!
Oh...
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
But not you.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
Like what?!  What?
Yes, please.
Oh, great.
No.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Hi!  Hi!
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
That's a beauty!
This is the second opinion.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
I want to experience childbirth.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Hey!
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Oh, God...
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
You're too demanding.
What's the matter?
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Well--
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Yeah.  Me, too.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Well...
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Right.
It's all right.
Okay.
Tch.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
I'm going to tell you later....
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Say it in English.
Then who's buying it?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
...they did it for a lark.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Yeah, so where is he?
You take this much time over everything?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
..It won't be long now, sir...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
I won't take much of his time.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Try Barney Clark.
No, no, of course not.
..suitcase...locker...
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
...standard issue...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
I think its meaning is clear.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
And?  Then?
...Franklin.
Where do you live?
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
...who say...?
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
Indeed we were.
And how did he do that?
What's that, Baby?
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Because...?
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
Hey, lost again.
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
For approval.
When?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Howdy Pouty.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Mine!
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
...sorry...
Do you really not believe in God?
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Gee, thanks.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
You stupid cunt!
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
What are you doing here?!
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
What do you want from me?
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
No.
Veronica, you look like hell.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
I thought I...you..
Let's kick his ass.
You going to eat this?
Answer him dick!
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Look who I've found!
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
I'm so happy to see you!
I think I'm dying . . .
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
It's so beautiful!
I shall call him Diello.
John has fallen in love with me!
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Are you a dream too?
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
The way you just looked at me...
Pitbull attacks.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
No.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
I have my connections
Yeah? You and who else?
Who's Allison?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
You win! Okay pull over.
In a word? Lucrative.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Never to put you in my will.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
What's under that sheet...?
Are you ready?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
I... I know that, John...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
It's not right, Gale...
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
Unprofessional.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
What's "cynical"?
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
So where are all your toys?
Are you being helped, sir?
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
-- hospital.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Yeah, that was easy.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
I found a cent!
Uh huh.
Did Daddy tease you?
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Neil -- what --
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
How were we -- were we cool?
He made, you know, a remark.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
The cab's waiting!
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
I'm having the floor fixed,
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
How large is your brood?
What did the thermometer say?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Do you see a man?
No.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Really?
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
This ties in with Nash.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
France.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
What worries you?
Well?
I'll go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
I would like to say goodbye.
Why?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
Corpses?
A lucky guess.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
You're twenty minutes late.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
We're holding the workers down below.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Is there anything else you need?
What are you doing?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
I guess so.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
What do you want to do?
You should warn them, Sonny.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Jesus.  What is this?
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
There is no way out.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Then we might as well die rich.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
What the fuck is that?
You got something to say?
I don't know.
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Please get away from me.
Thanks for the shirt.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
I can't go without Thomas.
Are civilians inside?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
I know the one.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Chief, Mikkelson.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
Special Agent Jones.
How about you and your sister?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Where's your gun?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
These disks . . . where are they?
What is this about?
How much?
Give me it.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
What's happening?
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders �we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.� What do you think would have happened? No different.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
We must go to the Diplomat.
Your police are at the gate?
When?
You lie.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Let's go.
Here, have a sandwich.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
What?
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Do something.
I couldn't help.
You could have asked for a favor.
Has Roger spoken yet?
I have to go out to get food.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
Yes.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What does it matter.
I want to know.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please do not talk like this.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
What are you doing?
Paul, are you there?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Don't think it'll be a problem.
What are you playing here, Price?
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
Pritchett, is that you?
Oh, Jesus....
Is she...alright?
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Why?
Most fun I've had all day.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
I don't think so...
You hear somebody?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
What are you looking for?
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
This is the best we're gonna do.
Price!!
You okay?
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Jesus!
-- wit...nesses --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
I was in the middle of --
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
-- my loss --
I think...I may have the answer.
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Rewind that.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Excuse me?
Price!
Something....happened --
It might have been her mother.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Where is she?
Help me!  Please!!!
Sure.  Did you see the others?
Why?
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Were you fooling with the power?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
We'll never know for sure.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
And what would you do?
Not on station time.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Sorry.
That's great.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Did you know him?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Buying some drugs, alright?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
I don't know.  Maybe.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
You're apologizing?
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Eighth room down, babe...
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
You got about five minutes and change.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
But I said I was sorry....
We're going in from the ground floor.
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
That was close....
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
My life is not some deal.  I...
How.
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
A little petting is not the issue!
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Way to go, Anna.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Get away from there, convict!
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
This is the worst night...
Don't I know you...
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
About seven minutes.
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Confused?
Sid found me the icepack.
...I'm sorry.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Your i --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Terrific.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
But, buddy, you were --
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
But, Buzz --
Yessir.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Yeah, tell me about it.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
I'd love to.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Mrs. Rand...
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
Yes -- on the boat.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
Mr. Holland?
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
No, Wes.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
Why did you come in here?
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
You wanted to warn me...
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Good night.
You want to go?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Dinner in ten minutes.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
I'm not surprised.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
In the car.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Hnnn.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Dad stop it!
Talking to me, dad?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
-- 73
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
A key party?
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Educated guess.
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Reverend Edwards.
What?
What do you mean?
Just be careful.
Yeah.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
My what?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Hood residence.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Are you his girlfriend?
Yes, sir.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Duggar called him?
No.
What happened at that signing?
You know my plan of action.
To do nothing.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
Your friend's all business.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
What kind of stuff?
I was her best friend.
Since grade school.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Hey...
My arm!
She used some stupid code name.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Yes.
I told you that was an accident!
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
So you have the answers...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
We want no quarrel with him.
I can't save her.
Your melancholy eyes...
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
And if I cut my hair again?
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Don't Louis --
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
You both did it?
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
And you never cried -
This is monstrous!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
Have you ever been caught?
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
The girl, Lestat -
Why do you do this Lestat?
NO!!!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
What are you saying?
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
Well, what a lucky break for me.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Did he die in the fire?
You found nothing?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
No... it can't end like that...
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Storm season?
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
Oh!
I'm the King of the World.
You get any sleep at all?
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm sorry.
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
What?
Julie? What's wrong?
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
He's in it with Willis?
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Why?
Hello?
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Must have missed the sign.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
No.  She shall not be left here.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are �� a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
What if he is?
That your father and I ��
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man � � working at him � � turning him against Thea.
Really, this is idiotic!
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live �- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ��
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
But the war, the army �� they need you.
If I told you �� you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you �� the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -�
You're crying. Why?
Thea, what's wrong?
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
I told you �� I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Where? I don't see a thing.
Hey, who's that?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
You sent for me, sir?
Thanks.
Hey, Ernie!
Mother . . .
When'd you see him last?
What boat you sailing on?
Oh, no �� you don't feel so good.
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
George! George!
No.
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Okay �� all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Huh?
Why didn't you call me?
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
With coconuts?
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
You may kiss my hand.
In that place?
Didn't you tell her?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
After that, who cares?
Have fun.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Yeah, just started.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
How fast is enough?
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Yeah, it's her job.
Maybe by now they are.
We better go back in.
Tina!
It's still there!
Good morning!
I never heard of a 908.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
Not the drugstore!
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Where to?
What else is there to do?
You stay here a minute.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The whale's mouth?
Probably.
Why?
Let's get the kid home.
Need a ride?
It's good with coffee.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
It was bad, wasn't it.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
What's wrong?
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Where the hell is Air One?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Can I go swimming?
Hi Dad.
Dad!  Dad!
I want you to meet my cousin.
Terry!  You okay?
Right after, the Kids went out?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
Hurry, please.
What's the lighthouse?
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Who wouldn't.
Wave to my son.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Yeah.
My imagination isn't that good.
You called, Doctor?
Yeah, you really don't like him.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
What do I do now?
Honey... you all right?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
It's romantic down here.
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
After what happened to us?
Change your mind?
I can use a shot of what he's got.
Yes.  It's faster.
It's a shark's tooth!
So?
What do you mean, we don't?
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
Who's going to do it?
Nobody told me.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
No, no.  That won't do.
Why?
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
Are you really?
How come?
It's okay, Sean.
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Did you see that?
What?
That?
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Calvin said it was all right.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Gee, it's good to see you!
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Like mother, like son....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
No....
Off....
What's wrong?  What happened?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
That hurt....
You check it....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
All you all right?
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
Depends on where you want to go....
It's just like driving a car....
You promised me a drink....
That's hard to imagine....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
Still tagging conch?
I wish there was something I could do....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
Will you leave me alone...?
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
They won't fight with me....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
When I invited you...
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
You getting a reading on them?
I don't like the song.
You told me what?
Your equipment has crapped out again....
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
Yeah?
Only me and Mom ..
Be my guest. What you got?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
What about that kid, Ross?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Listen to me saying what?
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Jesus. What are you doin?
What if we need a back up?
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Pray?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
I have to talk to you, Helena.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
You find something curious in that?
What was she like?
You think John would like it?
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
You want something, darling?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
I just heard.
Look, I don't want a --
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Oh come on --
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
You don't have to explain.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Oh God.
Tell me -- let me help --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Thank you.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Not right now, Jerry.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
You're telling me to dance.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
You never had The Talk, did you?
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why not --
Fine.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
I'll go back to them.
Marcee --
You wanted smaller.
No.
They do, my brother.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
Sorry.
How much weight have you lost?
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
Eric! Are you here?
Well what?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
When did you have it last?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
They couldn�t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
That does sound lucky.
Is it a rex?
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Baryonyx?
We could co-write a paper.
ALAN!
I try not to.
Good luck with the fund raising.
How much of this island have you explored?
But then you never get to go in space.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Just a little bit too much, I think.
How do you mean?
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
Minimal.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
What?
John . . .
I'm not going, John.
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
Why did you come here?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
That little black line?
Ask her.
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
What now?
You shouldn't use my name.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
There you are.  Out you come.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Why?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Constantly sick.
- - barfs them up - -
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
C'mon on, this way.
Why not?
I know, it's very exciting.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
He sends his apologies.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
I read your book.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
You got any kids?
You're married?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
The kids okay?
What kind of opinions?
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Let's go!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
We miss you.
No, but...
Yeah?
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
I don't know...
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Well?
He's fucking nuts.
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
That's open to debate.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
See this?
Great.	When can you do it?
You know how to use one of those?
Are you all right?
You work in the insurance department?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
My assistants, I presume.
Have you worked here long?
Success or nothing?
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
I usually take lunch by the River.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Are you free tonight?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Your office is the Workmen's --
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I'll bear that in mind.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
It usually is.
All these in the last year?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
You look tired.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
What have you got there?
Holy God! The mummy walks!
I want to thank you.
We're leaving.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Compassion.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Sure dear, yes.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Sorry. 
Yes indeed.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Oh no.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Honest?
No, I'm look --
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Thanks.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
How can you do it to yourself?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Go down in my room.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
I called Trina.
Mm.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
I can't follow you.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
She told me.
Then how are you involved?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Think this is our guy?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
What do you like best about your daddy?
In real life when does he hit you?
Greatest.
Show.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Uh huh...
I hate it.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Uh huh?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Yes?
Is that really your chair?
Uh huh...
Are you going to get remarried?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
I don't understand, daddy.
Objection!
I don't recall.
I consider it less my failure than his.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Ted, do you love him?
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Yeah?
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
I lost him?  I lost him?
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Yeah.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
Hey, that's terrific.
Again?
Where will you keep them?
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
I miss my brother.
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Do you think I must?
Does he have the spot?
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
I want to go down there.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
You, kill me?
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
Much too young.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Thank you.
I might get a shot.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
Mr. Cyr!
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Then do it!!
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Where is he?!
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
Right.
The more he thrashes, the better.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Thank you, Jack.
You take care.
I never had sex with you!
Such the flirt.
What?
He's gonna live?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
In Maine?
What are you doing?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Okay.
It can't work.
Hector!!
We gotta get to Hector!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
I'll take it!
He's done.  He's dying.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
What?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
You threw it at me!!
With what?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Are you alright?
That's not what you came to say.
Hey.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Shitbutt?
Hot damn, Clarice.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
You're all right! Where is he?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Okay, Miss Starling?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
What do you see, Starling?
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
It's much better than your shoes.
I have no doubt of it.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
The death of my father.
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
On what basis would they reject him?
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
I heard a strange sound...
Yes...! They were screaming.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
You know I can't make that promise.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
The Ottawa are gone.
I'm sorry.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
What?
And by sea!
Some say that's the way of it.
"Some"?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
What?!
Dark haired...
Head for... for the white water.
Will you men help us stop the French?
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Sir!
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Excuse me. What did you say?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
We're getting out of here just in time.
I thought they were your friends?
Jesus Christ...
That's an order!
You did good...
What?
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Where's Doc?!
What's wrong with it?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Yes sir...
What's going on?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
What are you going to do to him?
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
What is it?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
It's hit us all hard!
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
I thought this was a pub.
Like antiques.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
What are you doing?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
What they like then?
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Right, his leg's going now.
Out the back.
And the weed?
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
That's it all done, we are off.
Well, what's going on?
Tom?
I'll see ya.
I like your bar.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
I'll only be a minute.
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
How the fuck should I know?
The money, the gear!
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
What do you mean?
So?
Leave your sister out of it.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
No, sir--
I'm sorry, sir.
I-I can do the job, sir.
The--the officers.
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Why don't you start with that?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
We're not running a dating service here.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
I'm not picking it up.
You look good--
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Hey, it's the General.
Uncle Al--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
So they stayed in Florida?
They fought against the Indians?
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
You wouldn't?
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Mikey look at this--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Why would you want to do that?
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
Is very beautiful, your car.
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
This girl has a child?
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Seems like we have another one every week.
When we backed you--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
--Santiago.
Right.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
Besides my father, I mean.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
We have a murder?
Buddy Deeds--
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
There must have been somebody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
That's me.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
I don't think you can take it personally--
You gonna stay out here?
Can I get this?
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Field trip?
Your boy, there--
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
You've got your mother, your kids--
I mean what did we know about anything?
Wow.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Pilar--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
You're out early.
Uh-huh.
The Republicans?
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
Sure.
I know that.
They go together.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Right.
Right.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
He's a priest?
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
About?
Yes...
He's with us...
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Does that mean...?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
When do you want me to start?
Are they treating you okay?
I can be very persuasive.
How did it go today?
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Harry?
Harry-?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Shit.
It's one in the afternoon.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Maybe I just bought it.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Any movie stars buried here?
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh Jeez.
And he didn't have them?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
They got here before us.
Can you do it?
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
You could still help me do that.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
What are you doing here?
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Hello?
It's Charlotte.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Did I scowl at you?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
You're leaving right now?
Thanks.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Lydia?
Yeah, its really different here.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
That's ok.
Evelyn Waugh?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You wanna come?
No, what are you talking about.
Do you think it's done?
Will you please stop smoking?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Lauren?
Uh..thanks.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I spaced out.
Seemed...on edge.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You'll do it?
What is it?
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
Why are you doing this to me?
What's his name?
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You should think about getting professional help.
So what?
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
We need all the help we can get.
You don't want to face it.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
There weren't any voices.
Would you sign it for me?
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
Monica, what did you do?
nothing.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Taste this.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Hi.
Yeah, you met her?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
He's fine.
I can take it.
What?
What?
Sort of.
That was nice.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
I don't know sometimes.
No.
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
I found you someone.
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
What?
Your legs don't look broke.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
So she's honest.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Yeah.
He ain't Spalding.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
What?
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
She understands.
Quincy...
You want to go talk?
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Can we talk?
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
Few days ago.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
What?
I heard enough.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
Better late than never, right?
So you're gonna bitch up?
What will this prove?
Zeke.
At one in the morning?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You work too hard, Pop.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
What are you doing here?
Still is, so let yourself out.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
After five years.
Good.
Your teeth are straight.
You ok?
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
Does this sound weird?
It's a helluva disease.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
...Hello...?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
No.
Bit messy.
Yeah.
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
It's my favorite place --
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
please, what is it, please --
-- you the resident here?
Claudia.
How much time do we have?
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
How much you pay me for my help?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Did you listen to me?
What's up?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Picky, picky.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Mmm.Hmm.
Stay that way.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I paid you back.
Yeah.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Do me a personal favor --
Alright.  Thank you.
All it takes is one second?
Let's talk about --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
And what did your parents do?
Are you close?
She's my mother.
people die.
It's not your given name, right?
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
How long have you taken care of him?
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
How long...you think?
Uh. huh.
I'm really sorry.
The door was open, I got a call --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
Are you lyin' to me?
I preffer to stand.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
And what about screaming?
I went out last night.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
You on any medication?
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
What the hell is this Marcie?
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
Will you say my name?
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
Are you ok?
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Did you tell her?
I'm a bad person.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
I'll answer anything.
hey.
That's it.
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
What does that mean?
Hello.
Do you have that?
Yes. What? Yes.
Should be one-thirty.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
You coulda been in front --
Yes.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
How goes that favor I asked of you?
What do you propose to do?
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Go on.
We must stop him!
Aramis, this will never --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Bloody hell...
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
Who does?
What do we do now?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
It worked!
Do I look all right?
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
... You knew you had a double?
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
... The ball... Continue.
What number did you tear out?
... Two-thirty-seven.
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Cooperate?
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
What?
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Did you start out area six?
Well don't you think that's odd?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
And what did he do to the girl?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Up north.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
Read it.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
No.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
Get him to Atlanta.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Wait, Will...
When are you coming back?
'Changes?'
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
It's getting late and...
Parking permits...
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
How did you come to Gateway?
I have work to do at the plant.
I'll get my purse.
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
Okay.
What's average?
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
No.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Hey, baby! Where are you?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Hello.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
What's that?
That's right.
What do you want?
Are you George Sherman?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
Yes, I thought so.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
Yes. I'd considered it.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
Yes.
Kevlar Second Chance.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
People love... comedians.
You have to do it.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Hi... am I late?
Hi... am I late?
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
How can you be so casual??!
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
I'm gonna quit.
What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
Sir, do you have a problem?
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
I was very original!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Excuse me, Andy...
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
We had a deal!!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
You're two hours late.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
The Matrix isn't real!
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Just get me outta here.
Give me your phone.
... Yes.
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
You -- you're too fast.
Do you know why you didn't make it?
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
And she knows what?  Everything?
What do you believe in?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
We need an exit.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Who are you?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Gee-zus.
What?
Of what?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
From what?
What is this thing?
Is it?
I have to.
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
Do what?
Holy shit!
Neo, this has to be done!
Which way?  Which way?
Cypher, I thought --
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Know where he is?
Well, we want good stuff.
No.
Look at her.
She don't look Jewish.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Panther...
Next time, bet with your own kind.
I don't like loading crates.
I could have told you that.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Don't you move!!!
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
Disgraceful.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
How much?
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Fine.
Hostess?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Teresa.
Well...
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Can you spare it?
Sure.
That's your name?
His wife?
I don't like cake.
Do they, m'dear?
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Red or white?
Hello, Beautiful.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Drew, you're out of line.
Well... goodnight.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
You get not to go to jail.
Yah.
Sure.
Black.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
'Big'?
Come again?
I've got plenty of friends.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
To bed.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Did you like making love to me?
It gets worse.
But there's so much to tell you --
The 'coffee shop' --
I'm still here.
How long have I got?
Well, thank you for letting me know.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Joe --?
There's one to every rule.
That's what everybody says.
What do you mean?
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Truly - uh - splendid.
And more.
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
I was just asking, Bill.
Say again?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
I don't expect you to.
About what?
Yes what?
What question?
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
This one.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
I hope so.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Don't get carried away.
What were you going to say?
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Where is he?
Daddy --
I love you, Daddy --
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
No --
38.
What makes you think he's my friend?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
Jimmy?
Yeah, I remember you.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Deals?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Calls himself Dodd.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
On the house.
There's a dress code?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
How can you read that again?
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Yup?
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
You really want to find this guy?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Why are you following me?
Why?
Why?
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
You're not coming?
My wife wasn't diabetic.
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
You probably.							 *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
What do you think?
We're not certain...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
How many?
Make it 40%.
Where's that?
Where's she now?
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Available cash is not an issue for us...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
What friend?
Alonzo...
Hey, fuck him.
As in...?
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
That's right.
From whom...?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Oh, good...
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Who are you talking to?
Why?
So lay it out, my brother...
What do you care?
What...?
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You sure you heard what I said?
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Yeah, well, so?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Don't say nothing about you either.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
Hell, don't cry about it!
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Gonna be like money from home.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Sold. Let's go.
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Years?
How's your hernia?
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Yes...?
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Just Erich.
A hundred grams.
He wasn't even in the car?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
What?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Any luck?
I only got...
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Is there a switch?
Just inner chambers...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
It's no use! They know we're in here!
Rub it on the windows!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
Your arm, you can't...
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
Done?
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Perfect.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Misery's Return?
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
I can't write this anymore.
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
To Misery.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Don't talk to me like that.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
What is it?
People sure like those Misery books.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
If I can.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
All done, chief..
You won.
I suppose I did.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
What are you talking about?
Fight a bit of a cold..
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Ninety-three point four million.
..or hard wired..
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Do you know me?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
Can you think of a better one?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
He�s putting on a show, Barnes.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Max made a deal with you?
Two cars.  Where are you?
Ethan�s right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire.
They knew we were coming.  Golitsyn�s dead too.  The disk is gone.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Don�t <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Who else is left?
Yes.  I see your point.
I don't quite follow you.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Why don't you come back with me?
On what?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Very good.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Higher.  Higher.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
What problem?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
You�re probably right.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
What's going on?
Thirty-two and change.
What�s the problem.
Try it again.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Cosmo?
You're welcome.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
The guy died.
You're married.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
He's in Palermo.
Have you come from my brother?
Maybe I should come back another time.
No.
Seven years ago.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Me neither.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
She didn't like me.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
For what?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I know what I know.
This is your place.
Yeah.
Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You never have dessert.
I shouldn't.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
What about the wedding?
Who is he?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
No.
Hi.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
What! How do you know?
What? He's in Sicily!
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
So.
That's it! That's the reason!
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
What happened?
Yes.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Temperature's dropping.
Yes.
He's a plumber.
Rita. Rita.
Look.
Is who down there?
Cosmo.
You were a tiger last night.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
We don't have a lord.
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Stop that.
I'm invincible!
Well, what are you then?
Bedevere, my Liege.
They're nervous, sire.
We shall attack at once.
Greetings King Arthur.
What?
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
Yes, I see.
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
... Well, we did do the nose.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
What is your quest?
What is your favorite colour?
That's easy!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
How?
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
No, It's nothing!
Camelot ...
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We must examine you.
Hurry!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Seventy a year.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
What's this?
Be careful who sees it.
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Yeah.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
What did you say?
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
It is quite late enough.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
By whose authority?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Awaiting my orders.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
This is a slur on her good name.
Nobody has any rights over me.
What brings you here?
What do you know about the Highlands?
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
You're injured.
I'm not married.
They don't see it.
You are here safely.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Archie.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Aye, ma'am.
Those, over there, there.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Then why send me back to them?!
What can we do?
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Dear oh dear.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
I understand he was in a fight.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Why is he not here?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
What?
It's already out.
You mean we learn the rules...
No I'm not...
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Christ...no time...
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
You have no time.  What is your question?
So how do I start?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
Cool.
So start at the beginning...
They fired everyone.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
I'm going home.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Beautiful night.
Yes...what is it?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
It's unbelievable!
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
That's okay.
Very pleased to meet you.
No, no, I'm fine.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Yes?
Number 17.
But it said #12.
No.... I don't...
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
Good luck!
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
What's  the matter now?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
This Denny's.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Hardly.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Good morning. What do you have today ?
So what do we do ?
What are you doing ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
He hired you to build this place ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
And you believe that ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
You okay ?
I work here, remember ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
I thought you made this place ?
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
Is it over ?
What ?
Not yet.
When I think you're ready.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Excuse me, sir ?
I am thirty two.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Zachary.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
Then what do you want ?
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
How long till the drug wears off ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Thank you very much.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
Good morning.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
People said she looked like me.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
I don't think you're very polite.
Do what?
Okay, no problem.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Of course.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Never heard of him. 
How about a nice glass of milk?
No.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
It's just a corpse.
He likes you.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
WHAT??
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Good. I mean...
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Good morning.
Well maybe for you.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Shelly?
Beidermeyer?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
No.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Deceased.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Hi.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I had a good time tonight.
Here?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Shelly?
Pointing upwards Look...
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
I like the freak show.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Hi Vada.
What are you doing.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
In the garage.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Thank you. Bye.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
Do you like her?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Hi.
Big Ringo fan.
No, I'm divorced.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Where's Daddy?
I'm hemorrhaging.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Uh huh.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
No.
Hmmmm, interesting.
Do you remember her?
What?
Go???
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
I do, she's real funny.
It is not.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Like they do on TV?
Stay, huh?
You don't miss much.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
I have a suggestion...
No, he's ruining yours.
Go figure you.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Impressive.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
And loving him means loving all of this.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Please come, please.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
I never eat when I'm serene.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Don't you throw up on boat?
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Michael? What ha...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
... yeah, that.
Almost three.
And to m...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You got a real good memory, Star.
What do you have to buy?
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Barnett?
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
What do you really want?
Yes.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Have you talked to Triplette?
He has that sign with the tree.
What!
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
President?
You're kidding.
He's my father.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
Mr. Green?
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
How do you know?
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
When did you start singing?
No, I don't.
Hello.
Tom. You remember?
What?
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I'm not sure.
Thirty?
I'm not sure...
Fifteen minutes?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
What National TV...?
Sleeping.
Come on back to bed.
Why?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He is to a lot of people.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
You sure do it loud.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
More or less.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Yes you are.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
You been followin' the news coverage?
By all means.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Whose ratings were higher?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Tell me about the purity.
I'm sure we will.
Sure.
Where's it parked?
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Hypnotizing.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
Just for fun, I guess.
That's my opinion.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
And where do you keep Mickey?
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
When do you want the assembly?
It's gonna be beautiful.
How so?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Want me to come?
It sure is.
Okay.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Walker and Williams.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Don't say much, do you?
Have anything in mind?
Where was your father born?
Been over to the other mill?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Are you married?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
How did it go?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Don't push me, Duff.
Don't call them that.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Don't, Duff.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
Yeah!
Ain't you goin' to say something?
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
'Round town.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
See you, Duff.
I'm Duff.
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Take it easy, Pop.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Hello.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
I understand.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
What the hell is that?
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
What about McCoy?
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Tell me the words.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
I saw your girl yesterday.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
What elders?
Right...
No problem, amigo.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
That's not going to help.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Won't that mean you're dead?
I don't sleep much. You packed?
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
I'll be okay.
I know.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Well, do you?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
� uhh, must have forgotten-
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Anita!
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
How about this?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You've done five of my ideas.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
But I don't want it straightened out.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
That's your story!
Rob's?
Hey there.
Hey--what are you thinking about?
Hey Rob, what's going on?
See!
It's just for a couple of months.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You're twenty-three years old!
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Are you--scared?
You remember that story?
When are you going to open your eyes?
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
What?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Wow - I-
Where're we taking him?
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Taste it.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
You're fucked in the head.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
What?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
You okay?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
Who?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What is it - What's wrong?
It's gone now.
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
Okay, I guess.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
What?
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Research.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
You got five minutes.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Ms. Thompson.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Just until we get things under control.
Doesn't matter.
The truth.
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Your dreams?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
What did you think?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Uh, fourteen.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
She left me.
She saw through me.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Hi.  Can I come in?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Well, get a message through to him too.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Wow.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
How are you doing?
I don't know what happened.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Can I have your autograph?
What does it say?
Di Caprio.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
That's right -- Topol.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
Well?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Cool, huh?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
And she's in your house.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Was it you?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
And yet you suspect her.
Why?
Yes, Mister Harding?
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
On this ward?
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Whatcha boys playin'?
H-H-Hearts.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
H-H-Help!
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
I second the motion!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Mine, too!
I'll bet a dollar.
Martini!
What are you doing?
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
With your own two hands?
Twenty-five dollars.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Hear what?
When?
Bet a nickel!
Hit me!
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Right!
Oh, what's that?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Time out!
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Hi.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
I'm sure you will.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Is everything all right?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
She was your sister.
Your mother.
Excuse me?
Why?
--separate, in the evening..."
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
But, Faith--
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Thanks.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Who's this?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Why can't you just tell me?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
He's out by the pool right now.
Hi, Peter.
So.  You found him.
And she's a knock-out, too.
What?
No.  Are you're leaving?
Is something the matter?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
What would you call it?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Really?...
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Well, to-- new friends.
Scientologist.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
What's he do?
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
What about your job?
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
What is it?
You think he misses me at all?
That was a long time ago.
Larry bought himself cologne?
He's heeeeeerrre...
And then what, Faith?
That was really sweet...
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
What if he doesn't like me?
My God... you're right.
Maybe I can change him.
What about Larry?
And you are?...
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Giovanni.
No, why?
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
What?  You know him?
Mania.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
Sure we keep records!
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Yeah� yeah� I guess I do� but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals� you know what they're worth to us?
Wow... .
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
I don't know.
That was nice of you.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
I� I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And� I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
I don't rate it.
Edie� I� I� never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you� you're... .
Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.
Don't tell me� don't tell me!
I know what you want me to do!
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Jimmy...
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
�It started as a favor� for my brother� you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no� a favor� Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but� Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it� stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away� and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
You all right, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
Are you on the level, Father?
Down to the wire?
So help me God!
I told you lay off.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
No.
Terry?  What do you want?
Hey, Skins�  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Thirty-six� sev� aah I lost the count.
Aw, Johnny... .
You want to know somethin'�?
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
It frightens me.
Be careful!
You're talking nonsense.
What can we do against them?
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
A symbol, Master.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
The moon is almost gone!
Yes, Master.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
Then why do you shake so?
Then it is some service you desire of us.
What do you suppose for?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Why not?
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Jack?
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Let's go to Detroit.
Whatta you think?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
You know how I felt about her.
I don't ski.
They look like plain old rocks.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
You talked to him?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
It was an unusual experience.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Quite a mess.
No, I didn't know that.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Who's sitting here?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
I can go to the bar.
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
You did?
It smelled.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
You believe that?
What were you gonna do with me?
To warn her about Chino.
So.  What's your point?
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
You know who they are?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
Hi, Ray.
I can tell.
You're not my type.
Moselle Miller?
You not with probation, one of those?
Your dog was killed?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Oh, he's moved out?
He doesn't even look like that.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
You wave back?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
You here all by yourself?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
I think he must've fell in.
I found a rubber.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Are you sure they're here?
I wish she could forget him.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Good shooting, Danny!
Didn't you say test the limits?
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
Sorry.
What facts are those?
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
They're all over us!
Fun today.  Like old times.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Yeah.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
How'd you get this?
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Oh, this is Betty.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
Rafe --
It must of been a convincing letter.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Do you have to wear that hat?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Where is it?
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Is this slow enough for you?
He's trying.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
What're you doing here?
Does this mean you like me again?
Forget it, it'll never work.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Come back to me.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Yes, sir.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
I beg your pardon?
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
This is great reefer.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
I'd love to.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
At my age? Don't be silly.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
But accidents can happen.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
What a great kite.
Sort of.
What's that?
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
Come on. You can't be serious.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Is something wrong?
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
All set?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Is this a good spot?
Why not?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
How did it go with your father last night?
Are we interrupting, Andy?
One hour!
Jerk... What did you say?
We're not skipping this treatment.
What's wrong with you?
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
About my blood work?
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Client of yours?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Continue.
Big trouble.
Thanks for your time.
Find a lawyer?
They didn't fire her?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
Opera?
What impressed you about him?
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
Yes. On my torso.
Yes.
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
What can I do?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
No.
That's right.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Answer the question, please.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Why are we going to do that?
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Don't know, Joe.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Julius!
Charles...
He was doing a great job.
What? What is it?
You came for us....
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Tell me that was you.
Bottle-count.
Bring the light!
'Mean the whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
But I just wanted to say --
Back to the ship, huh?
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
What?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
We cannot go through there....
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
What?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
"God is Great," yes?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Said "looks clear."
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Where does the river lead?
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
The evidence was very meager --
Got your sensors?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Huh?
He's trying to form words.
What signal?
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
I want her.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
What?
The Hunt Club.
What is that?
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
This is a joke in very poor taste.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
What is your proposal?
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Taylor! Tell him.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
We can't.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Come on man!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
...But what'd she do?
...don't feel like it either.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
What are you talking about! 
You know what I'm talking about!
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Right...
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
I'm supposing.

What's the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Bank?
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
Nice of him.
Dance? Tonight?
Just who are you, anyway?
Want to dance?
I didn't notice him.
Why?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
No percentage in that.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
Killaine...
Well?
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Ale. I don't mind.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Who told you I was married?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I expected nothing else.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
Very ridiculous.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
What will they do to you?
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
What's a buzzer?
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Could we discuss that some other time?
Doesn't answer the question.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Did I do something wrong?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Mitchell.
With what motive?
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
I've met her.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
I don't understand.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
The card says so, doesn't it?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Ye have, have ye?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Get out of here!
What are my orders, sir?
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Why should I mind?
You ought to know why.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
I told you she's just..
Right.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
What a shame.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now � the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
How's Mary?
It's terribly good.
...break away completely from--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Oh, but he was terrific.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Again?
You don't trust me.
In radio we're different.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Might?
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
Still in love?
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Have you come to talk about me?
So how is she?
No.
You gotta earn trust.
You're a fucking dead man--
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Johnny, it's the only way.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
This gonna take long?
Nice place.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Who cares!
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Why us?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
You're wastin' your time.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
That's over the border, General.
No.
You what?
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Yes.
Sit... and spin.
Nice car.  Yours?
You're not from L.A., huh?
What motel you staying at?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
What's your name, lover.
What?
Better believe it.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Diet coke.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
And why do you say that?
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
What are assets?
But you want days too.
All right, two thousand.
Did you buy some clothes?
This isn't a date.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
I got tired of hating my father.
You're packing.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Did I wake you?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I don't think there's any sense in --
You broke my nose.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
Was that you?
Dummy.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Yeah, what?
Rent.  You're late.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
You bullshittin' me?
I leave extras, miss.
You're a guest here?
I got a dress.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Yeah, well, I check out today.
May I help you?
What?
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
You mock my pain!
I fear I'll never see you again.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Why is that, do you think?
Why should that make such a difference?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Who's Guilder?
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Faster!
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
A book?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
Who gets Humperdinck?
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Where's Fezzik?
-- anything you want --
We're really in a terrible rush.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Sorry.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You are wonderful!
There's something I ought to tell you.
I want to duel him left-handed.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
What's so funny?
You guessed wrong.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
An hour.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Where would you like to eat?
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
I never should have listened to you.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Yes.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
By the sacred memory...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Okay.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
We won.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
I'm not the police.
What?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No.
I live there. Alone.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Forty thousand dollars.
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
Where's the old highway?
Our Deputy sleeps.
Does that mean we can't...
Yes.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
This is the old highway.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
What makes you sound so certain?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
Can you?
I can come down next week.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
Uncommon, too.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Is there?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Did I?
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
What's down there?
Yes.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
There's no hurry. It's early.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
What does that prove?
Make it snappy, Colonel.
It's all yours.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
You go in for dangerous things.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
To lunch.
But I have some friends waiting.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Yep. Everything settled.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
What?
Could you?
Where to?
Of what?
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
I've been dreaming about this.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
But who were they?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
What is it, Rose?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Don't mention it.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
You better quit that.
Yeah.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
I do, too!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Open that door, damn you!
What'd you say, Brother?
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
Wow! Brrrother!
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
How could that be, son?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
I am not being brutal to her!
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Boys? You say to me boys?
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Yes, sir.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Well, it's Billy.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
What and?  That's what I got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
She's fine, as if you cared.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
No you can't.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I'm just saying...
Where you gonna be?
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
What about him?
They shot us all, kid.
How you doing back there?
Happy Independence Day.
That's him alright.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Our resignations.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
You can't be serious.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Oh yeah?
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Come again... ?
No more counting the big money for someone else.
I don't think so.
You see that?
This shit was Ming.
They're... around.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Where am I?
Yes, my Master.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Luke.
Vader's on that ship.
I thought she was with you.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Leia!
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Lower it!
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
What did he say?
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
All wings report in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
I will not fight you.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
I was telling the truth.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Brad...
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
What a guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
Wheeling
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I suppose.
It doesn't bother me either.
I don't think you're a bum.
I think he might be worried.
They're all the same.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Do me another favor?
'Bout seven.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Sharp -- Real nice.
-- The legs.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...What?
...What?
Why?
Paulie!
It's not your house --
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
My side.
No doctor!
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Of wa?
I don't like ya face.
...That's an old one.
Seven minutes!
Here -- Three minutes.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
...Thanks.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Did you hear what I said?
Hey --
I like yella teeth.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
The legs must be goin'.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
...No.
Did ya get the message, kid?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Yo, Benny.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Would you keep goin'?
How I look out there, Mick?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Yo, Paulie.
Looks, huh?
Don't get mental, man.
Ya always in a bad mood --
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
...Maybe I better forget it.
What's ya sister like to do?
...Tight.
Whatta you think?
What?
Ya really like her?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Whatta these guys want?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Check the scrawl.
So you decided to help him after all?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
So you're Cloverleaf?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Wrong number?
Yeah?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Romeo! Romeo!
By my head here come the Capulets.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Teach me how I should forget to think.
He shall be endured
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Pink for flower.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Do you have it?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
Who the fuck are you?
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
What in bloody hell is going on?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
Now, what did we steal?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
Don't do it, Sam!
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
But you hate each other!
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Is it done?
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Soon.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
The question still remains: what do we do now?
What's going on?
It was at that.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
Closest and oldest.
What?
What of it?
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
What happened to it?
Ten thousand right here.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Well someone's gonna find them.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
Okay then.  I'll do it.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
What are you thinking?
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
Well, I don't know...
How much?
Shut up, Jesse.
Whoa, Earl!
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
What's that?
Yeah?  So?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Yeah.
OK.
Nothing happened?
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
A satellite dish?
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Test the product?
Yeah.
What?
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Sheriff Hogan --
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I�d have found it in a minute.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
What's this?
What are you saying?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Dwayne please calm down!
I was on a roll!  I�m a little overextended now.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Don't hurt me.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
No, sir.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
This is your ship?
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
Yeah, that's right.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
That's right.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
No.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
What'd I say?
You lied to me.
Hello.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
It's my job!
Who died?
I'm okay, you go.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
Good at what?
IT IS CRAZY!
You said --
Who?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
No.  It's not right.
What's she doing?
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Get it out of here!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Vegas...
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Carter...
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
What is this?
This money is evidence.
New York City?
A little Mu-shu.
You move well.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Any leads?
Did you tell Sterling?
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
You have one of these?
That silly-ass look on your face.
Witnesses.
It was not my intent --
Did you make the plate?!
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
They put you in charge?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
How much they want?
I'm talking about the girl.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
You have what I asked for?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
Ahh.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Good one!  Thanks.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Rub your ears.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
Of course we are.  Of course.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Looking for Maggie.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Like her mother.
Really?
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
Highly suspect.
I'm a work in progress.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
I don't know.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Kind of isolated.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Yes I do!
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
About a minute...?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
I'm going to kill myself.
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
A harmless joke.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Is there somebody else?
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
But it's on the water.
Am I what they had in mind?
Nope.
Happy New Year, darling.
Walter, I'd love to --
That doesn't make any sense.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
It was my mother's.
So what happened?
It's not true, but it feels true.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
You told a lie and got on a plane.
I love that dream.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Magic.  It was magic.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
Why not?
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Hey, my plate is full.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Dad --
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Great.
I just called for a second.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
You want 'em all arrested?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
Why are they singing, Mama?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Where you going?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
Tell me.
Where are you going?
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Like what?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No ...
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Yeah.
What?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Not even a guess?
Did you see his hair color?
You like that?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
How?
Then leave.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Fuck you.
Why don't you call the cops?
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
What happened to your eye?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Who is it?
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
You don't say.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
You want a hit?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Was he the president?
When? When did you ever see me use?
I don't trust anybody.
By not disgracing her memory!
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.
But I just met you.
I'm sorry?
Come on, guys ...
Just some buddies.
Cool it. We got business.
No last name?
You think I'm a Judas?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
What're your taking down?
That's because he doesn't have one.
To who?
What?!
What'd you do, piss your pants?
And you've got wiener breath.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
My sentiments exactly.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Casualties?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
But, sir...I...I...
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
No kiddin'?
I'd love to hear it.
In the shadow by those two trees.
You know classical music?
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
What about our grenades?
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Worked, didn't it?
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Yeah.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
I know.
You're welcome, John.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
HERE THEY COME!
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
Shit, sir.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
How fast?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Because he's guilty.
Speak with my lawyer.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Gee, it's easy.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
Hang in there, man.
Yes.
I'll put this past my boss
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
I'm sorry.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Okay, I give up.
Lloyd?
Honey, it's not what you think.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Alright.
Thank you very much.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
No, I read it on the message.
Goodbye.
Whoa.
Thank-you.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
It's just you and your dad, right?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
After work?
Come on.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Okay, this is important...
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
We'll see.
Okay, what did we just decide?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Is this because of your dad?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What do you want?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Okay.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Uh... okay... um...
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
I know this part, keep reading.
My car.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
What?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
I was gonna...
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
You know what, you'd like her.
What?
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
In Breslau.
We started without you.
It's bad business.
He's important to my business.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
You took my workers.
When?
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
You asked for shoe polish.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
Good.  How's it going?
Pots and pans.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
I got to go, I'll see you.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Hang up...call...
Someone who wants to talk to you.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
What?
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
What are you going to do?
I think he's doing Dolly.
Yeah.
Let us decide that.
No, it's not.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
She's got guards with her.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It�s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Who is this?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
It's good to see you involved.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
How many guys they have on you?
And white.
She's not here right now.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
I'll be right back.
What was that?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
Who is this?
Really? You're such a talented actor.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
You used to say that was our strength.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Your life?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Let's get out of here!
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Owwww...
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Now that it's out of your system.
So...
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Are you serious?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Do you like scary movies?
No.
Why do you want to know my name?
I have to go now.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
What's his name?
Please go away! Leave us alone!
What?
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
No, not yet.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I'll call for backup.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
I don't know. I guess.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
Drive by patrol.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
That fish smelled strong.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
So who are you?
Uh-huh.
Can you knock?
Stu was with me last night.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Working, thank you.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Do they know who did it?
Or a man's mentality.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
TATUM!
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
For once, Stu, drop it.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
It's none of my business anymore.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
What?
It's too soon for him.
How's that?
What about sports?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Punishing.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
This is the one thing.
I know.
Nothing.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
He just may be nuts enough.
I wish I still thought like you.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
It's not what you think it is.
What are you going to say?
Wait... just wait.
Think about it...
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Throw your gun down now!
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
You askin' me to clear out now?
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
You ain't goin'...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
How many, would you say?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Nothing for you to see.
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
What?
Not far from it...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
She'd be about thirteen now...
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
It still worked in town.
Do you have a better idea?
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Who was that?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Where have you been?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
What?
And that is?
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Yes.
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Never!
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Nothing comes.
Will it restore my gift?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter�Almost finished?
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
by order of the Master of the Revels!
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
No Juliet?!
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Where are you going?
I did not.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
The show must � you know
Go on.
How goes it, Will?
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo is�Italian. Always in and out of love.
"But new struck nine."
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Your Majesty!
"Madam!"
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"�Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
But the plague
Oh but why "alas?"
And that was only my first try.
There is time. It is still dark.
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
But why me?
I mean�Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
She loves me, Thomas!
I � Her letter came to me by the nurse.
She sings too?
What of her bosom?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
A theatre poet?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
What's his name?
Just serve.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
I'm only asking what you think.
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
He's still here.
When are you going to let the police know?
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
Security.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
But they know.
Not at all.
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Is this being recorded?
Are you recording it?
Parked outside?
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
And you like it?
What?
Cameron.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
For the flat.
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
I wonder how he did it?
What?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Stop nagging.
Hello. Hello.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Aren't you going to answer it?
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Can you afford this place?
Downstairs.
No, I've never seen them.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred pounds?
Who have you talked to?
I thought you'd gone to work.
Yes.
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Yes, sir.
You get the job done.
What guy that died?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
No. But he needs treatment.
And that's not the same thing?
Diseases.
Chicken salad.
I don't know, I think...
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
I just thought you'd like to know --
Lester.
We cannot go into this later.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I can see that.
Is she all right?
-- Anyway.
Hi.
Well she...
That headboard.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Yeah.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Chopped liver?
Yeah.
I am not like my mother!
She is.
I guess not...
Pardon me?
Yeah.
Buffums?
Yes, Buffums.
Jesus...
Where do you want to do this?
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
... I don't get it done often.
Why not?
It was after you, baby. After you.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, baby...
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down.
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
-- you are.
You were great.
Am I entertaining you?
What's wrong?
I don't know... Jackie?
No, man.
What?
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
Here in the canyon.
Who?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Yeah, baby.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Great.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Go where?
Whether or not I'm going.
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- go ahead.
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
What is.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
What? What? What? What? What?
George...
Stop it.
You need a cut.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
They're not?
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Oh, hey...
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
What can I say!
Didn't they tell you?
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Oh yeah...
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
She's nothing but a whore.
Yes I do.
Awww --
What do you mean?
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A soap?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Who are they?
Jackie, what're you doing?
I am? I mean why?
So what's your point?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Oh. thank you.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
-- I'll get in the back --
-- yes, Jill.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
Maybe he showed me something.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
What about Room 237?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
It's so pretty.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Sure.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
Yes.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
He's still asleep.
Why?
Stay away from me!  Please...
I'm gonna go now.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Blue. This blue.
Can I tell you kids something?
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Where's Mom?
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
Sure.
What is it?
Was it a prescription?
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
SING!
SING!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
What?
Vince...
You bastard!
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
No... it's fine.
Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Is this... choir practice?
That machine.
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
It'll be hell.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
What?
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mary Clarence!
What? 
And all those like you.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
What's a concubine?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
Is this all the food I get?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
You're my Olympic event.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
What do you mean?
You sent for me?
But...
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Oh?
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Vince knows you're here.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
A nun?
There she is!
You didn't shoot!
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
Yes?
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Many have.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
What the hell are you doing?
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
You need to sleep.
What?
It is sacrilege!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Damn... damn... damn...
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Listen to what you say....
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
What kind of nuts?
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Father said witches live there.
Listen.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
True enough.
What is it?
All I saw was their lantern.
What now?  Where is she?
What now?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
People have put their trust in you.
Why would you do such a thing?
Returning to the Western Woods?
Yes, actually.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
What... what are you doing?
She is guilty.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
What you got in there, warshing?
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
What?
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
I hate you!
Sure, I guess.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
Childers.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Maybe they needed it.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
You want to go with me?
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Naw.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Why not? It died?
So it died when it come out?
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Yeah.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got no boy.
You better go get your things.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Thank ye.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
That boy wants me to.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
No! At least I don't think I am!
I confess.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
What do you mean?
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Not a peep.
I'm all ears.
Every word.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Eighteen and a half years.
You're looking good, Auggie.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Yeah, like what?
And you're giving it to me?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
It's for you.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Does it hurt?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Thomas.
Well?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Baby? And what baby is that?
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Hey, it's you.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
You don't really want to know.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
That's it. In a nutshell.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Yes, please.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Why?  If they could never take title.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
A thousand.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Well, why does it?
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
And what's that?
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
It is.
I believe so.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
What else could it be?
Obviously.
The same.
For certain, no.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Fight it.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
How can we?  We're broke.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Me?  After Sugar?
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
What message?  What motorboat?
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Oh.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
All right - so what do we do now?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Good night, Sugar.
How's the bottle?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
I'll carry the instruments.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
I hope so.
Brand new.
Where did you girls play before?
It's about the Florida job.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
You invest in shows?
I'm not surprised.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
I'll throw up!
You're leading again.
Pleased to meet you.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Why not?
I don't care.
I forgive you.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
Why?
And you'll be in all evening?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Rough?
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Saxophone player?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
What makes you so sure?
You're not hurt, are you?
No, my flag steward.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Shell Oil?
One of whom?
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What's on Thursdays?
What happened?
How can you think about food at a time like this?
What else is there for me? 
Is it that hopeless?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
It's like smoking without inhaling.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Me?
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Big joke!
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
What for?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
Oh, shut up and be happy. It�s always this or that. You�re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Say something. Please.
Does Kat know?
Mom�s refining her strategy for DDay.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she�s getting married.
That�s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
I didn�t deserve her back then.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
Um, news flash: I don�t give a shit.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Not for a dog.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they�re naked.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don�t think he wants me back?
That won�t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
You quitting?
What?
You stand on your tiptoes.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Yes.
Subtle?
When I said I�d never done a wedding before, I didn�t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
You�re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Hi.
You have more than one gynecologist?
What�s he do anyway?
Hey, Sal.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Hi, kiddo.
Yeah.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You don't live around here, do you?
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Yes, mam...
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
It's cold, Daddy!
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Well, looka here...
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
When's that?
Yes, David...
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Whatcha got there?
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
I wanta get some things.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Will they give him a trial?
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
Why the fuck not?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
You're late, Cartman!
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Mph rmph rm!!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
The N word?
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
Uhh...
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Yeah, so what do we say?
Huh?
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
No, it was worse than that...
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
How is the children's progress?
It's from your mother.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
AGH!
What if I just left?
Wendy?
Jesus, come on!
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
What did you say to me?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
You gotta think of your old age.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Really?
What are we going to do?
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
OK...it's open.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Taylor?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Carlo!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Can I get you something for the road?
Heh, heh, heh.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
La da da dalala...
It's a beautiful thing.
Theo.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Grace Skinner.
I'm your blood.
Don't say that about my mom!
We ain't married no more.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I never saw you.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Uh...over easy.
Junior who?
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Isn't this technically a scooter?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
The mental hospital.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
What's plan B?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
More than you could afford.
Too late for what, Sheila?
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
Are you sure he's dead?
Theo, Buzz is dead.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
Very professional.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Hold on --
Thirty yards.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
What's wrong with oxygen?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
She should've known better.
Edmunds?
Can you open that panel?
Nothing, sir.
It's chipped.
We had considered it.
How can he be missing?
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
Edmunds?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
I love secrets.
It never occurred to me.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
We have a library?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What?  Why...
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
It's not worth the risk.
In case you die, too?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
None of this was here before.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
Page 87.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
But why is he doing it?
Looks like some sort of code.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
What's that?
How fast does it take effect?
Where are you?
What do you mean, different?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
That's when you went in the sphere.
Is it?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
No.  I don't think so.
In time for what?
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Where's it coming from?
You holding up alright?
I'm not being defensive.
Nice work, Norman.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
I can't believe that, Harry.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
... you there?  Norman?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Wisconsin's your answer.
How do we decode it?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
I don't think so.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Beth and Harry?
What was that, sir?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
You've heard of me?
Huh?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
You mean a picture?
I don't see anything.
I don't know.
Well, we'll see...
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Who are you anyway?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
What do you mean?
How can you store an energy field within you?
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Mobile Infantery rules !
Sir, no, sir.
Did you read her mind ?
How do you make him do that ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I'm all ears.
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Funny...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
None at all... We won.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Are you the boy for me ?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
You talk to Carl ?
You don't look very happy to see me.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
What ?
Way to go, amigo !
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Is that your signature, Rico ?
What do you think you're doing ?
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
They have repressed the Creator.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
You are what...?
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
May I ask Why?
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Go you Huskies?
I have one, but they lost it.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
What's it called?
I just got kicked off my first movie.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Of course.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Me?
Great.  Who is it...?
It's for your finger.
Hi.
I used to go out with a politician.
I can't get it to come out right.
What've you got?
What?
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
That's something a man could do...?
Sleep well?
Oh yeah.
...and we could get up every morning...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
After Drama Group.
What is it, a surprise?
What, what what are you doing here?
What are they offering?
I'm sorry.
Mornin', Doc...
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
What?
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
They think it's your First Wife...
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
There's other things to be learned.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I want you to hear this.
Look.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
But not that <u>way</u>...
We're just talking about the...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
He treated me as if I were a child...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
I'll put the, in your r...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
I can't tell.
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
He didn't have to tell...
I...
I'm looking for the writer.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
I...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I know you do.
I don't drink.
Hi!
No.
How do you know you saw it?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
Did you bring Bob's weights?
What's in all the bags?
I don't got the money.
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
...the damn thing...
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
How would you know sh...
...why do you think?
Like how?
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
You don't like his friends.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
She still packing for her trip?
You think this is funny?
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Great.  Big ears, too?
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Ice cold water.
You do NOT run out on your moth...
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
I have lava.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
So we'll...radiate some more?
Are you here?
Rachel's not half my age.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
Me too.
You're WHERE?
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Not personally.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
I don't know wh...
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
It's the same choice you made.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
I trust you of course I do but --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
No problem.
What a great surpri...
Yes.
Really? How many?
You have a bay?
He's dead.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
I know!
Why was he on Death Row?
This is definitely better.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious�But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
What's an audience going to tell you?
Don't even joke about that!
Was anyone in my room today?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
I dunno.
The same.
Dad?�Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
What are you doing here?
You're not.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
That's too bad.
I do.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
You know...I like you.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
What is most important to you?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What do you think?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
Enjoying the tour so far?
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
I insist...
Well?
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
If I don't get power up we are!
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Thank you, Admiral.
What's the meaning of this?
Yes?
Give that back to me.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
You mean you'll tell us his name???
That's right, fella.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Yes!
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
What shall we drink to, sir?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I guess so.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Then there's no chance for recall?
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
General, stick to the point, please.
A through H is correct.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Where'd they get you?
No kidding.
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
I've got one.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
He's dead, all right.
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Like hell it does.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Maybe the warning system's out.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Sure, King.
But who would be chosen?
How long were you in there?
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Hey!
It's really not about anything.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Sounds like a bummer.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
I'd get bored.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
No, I mean, no one.
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
Tim...
Yeah, man.
Ah, you know people there?
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Really?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Hey, man.
Oh, you were in the band?
Shit.
I will.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Glad it's okay.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Yeah, we're all above that.
You make videos?
Yeah!
Come on. Inside.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
He is.
Erica.
Deep down. Way down.
It's a mistake to think that.
It's coming along.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
No.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Why we're just standing here.
I hate that.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
But do you stand for anything?
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
What?
Nothing.
New ground?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Mm-hm.
I, yeah.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
Go.
You really suck, you know that?
No, it's not...
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
The prom. That's funny.
What do you mean?
Hey, where's Erica?
I hope you're happy!
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
Like?
No, she was just sitting there?!
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
I'm moving.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Sorry, Kansas...
Holy shit.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Madonna.
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
Or, I could get my own horse...
Hannah, we've...
Really...
Definitely old.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
If I could be of any help...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Why, you sweet kid.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
You did?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
You sure have.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
I'll make it short.
What has Artie to do with it.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
What were you -- a child actress?
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
It must be my new shampoo.
Why did she call me?
No.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Gordon Cole?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
There sure is.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
What scene?
I've lost my car.
The other guests?
You think this is all very funny.
A little.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What are the notes?
Keep it.
Go away.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
I ran into some people I knew.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
Good night.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Is that so!
What's the matter, Max?
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
A Storm Dragon?
Eliminate her.
Whatever you say.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Like it?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
What's that?
You're not afraid are you?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Is this how?
A little.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I did.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Why the empty cage?
What about my proposal?
How do you know?
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
You're not...an orphan are you?
No thanks. You go on.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
It doesn't seem right.
He's nice.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
Nigel, get lost.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Who are you ?
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
What's it like?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
Zaltar, please help me.
But it's impossible.
The kid needs a man to show him --
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Who?
You...um...you never got married?
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
I can never get a way from it.
He really was!
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
God, that's what I keep you for.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Now...when do I get a taste?
For what?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
You designed it?
Stone mutha.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
How you doing down there?
Watch out for them air pockets!
I know, by computers.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Oh, Superman!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Mr. White, the next number, please?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
He's the only one who can operate this --
Anybody been hurt?
Uh. . .
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Maybe I could try --
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Lois, someday --
Lois, I really don't see why --
Uh...home...
Does she know about it? She's in it!
Good. My heart can't take it.
This way Lex.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
To ski?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
What shall we do now?
You're late. Very late.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I think there's an angle.
But he's never there.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
You think he'll find us.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
One of them should've been you.
I've been on the job.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mother...
Are there any more at home like you?
Hey!
Know what?
Oh.
Not unless you can fly.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Listen...thank you.
Screaming
Besides that.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
Damn!  This will get him.
No news is not good news. Y'know
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
You can't do this to me!
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Do you like pink?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
I gave him this new face.
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
They'll soon be over.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Alison.
Alison.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Yes.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
For rabbits?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
From what?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
What do you mean?
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
So do you like your new room?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Why?
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Yes.
Crafts.
Tell me about it.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Yes.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
You've been retained?
Who did they get for that?
So you're just the thing we need.
Are you a reporter?
Any criminal record?
What time in the morning was this?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
You saw the speedometer?
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
See my mother?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Is it news to you?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
Can I come in for a minute?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Sidney, I told you -
What about?
Could this be that boy?
That's the third time he's called today.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
What's the matter?
That's no way to talk...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Why me...?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
We stick in each others craw.
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
I tried to reach you twice -
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
Why did you call me?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
My God.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Drive faster.
Drive for a minute.
No!
No shit?
They took him from me.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I must be destroyed.
Are you afraid?
Eating is eating... and...
What does he mean, too correct?
Where you from, David?
What's that mean?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Five minutes.
What?
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
No can do.
I have a duty.
You do shorthand and typing?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Your mother, too.
I'm sorry.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw�ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtw�ngler today?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtw�ngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Like this bandleader.
First oboe.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Great.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
Kyle.
It's okay.  Forget it.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
I'm sure.
Is this enough?
I don't think I like this.
What are you doing?
And who was the enemy?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Why were the other two women killed?
Here, drink some of this...
The stock will turn.
Now, look...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I could fight you on this.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
You deserted me.
A fresh shirt...
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
What is this!?
Who are "they?"
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Nicholas...
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Where'd you get that... ?
What the fuck are you... ?
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
About me?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Yeah.
Call that number.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
What's this all about, Connie?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Yes.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I'll call.  I really will.
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
Drive in.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Didn't I give you two?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Goodnight.  See you home.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I wasn't expecting you.
He hasn't called back.
It's a question.
It's not going to hold your weight.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Nell!
And that will be a good place to end this study.
Are you working with her?
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
What happened after you smelled it?
Like she smelled it too?
Hmm.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Is she asleep?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Mrs. Dudley.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Jeez.
What's his first name?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
Am I a thing?
I'm not.
It's not a compliment.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
What's the matter?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
You broke last time.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Y'what?
Did Jenny know?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Steady on.
Same.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Oh, it just ended, then.
When did you get in?
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Nah, accommodation address.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Why not.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Just now?  Overnight?
What about your grandmother?
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Where is he now?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Yes. Thank you.
Yes, Ann?
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...Uh-huh.
Huh.
...I wanted to make you happy.
...You are ze fahzer?
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
That right.
Huh.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sure.
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
Cash.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
She's a rare one.
...Ed, I...
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
How much to they want, Dave?
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Who?
Dave.
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
I'm fine.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Taking it seriously.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
You don't got a headache?
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
That's very generous.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Anything missin'?
Sweet Jesus!
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
Call me Vince.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
How big is the sub-basement?
Apparently it's huge.
Lieutenant!  It's me.
Got my hands full here.
It's still back there!
Dr. John Whittlesley.
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Yes.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
This room sucks.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
They've got something.
Oh... my... God!
That's impossible.
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
I don't understand.
Where would we find it?
Gone.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
You want to book the flight?
Close up?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
Thank you.
That and a fat, new contract.
Certainly a nomination.
I have a map.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
No.
Yeah, what happened?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
Your Dad?!
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
I won't be late.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
So why do you want to go?
There's been an accident, Truman.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Who were you talking to?!
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Were you there--how do you know?
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
I need your clothes, Byers.
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Working with?
No, they don't.
You've got something to show me.
Of what?
Who?
You follow me out here for a reason?
I know the name. Why?
You a reporter?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
-- You saw this experiment?
That would be my guess.
You told me you had answers.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Where are you, Scully?
I think they have that covered.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
You think they went left?
This virus -- it... 
Yeah...?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
Where's Scully?
What is it?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
Why are you telling me this?
Let me out. Stop the car.
My god...
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Sing a song of sixpence.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
You don't know the procedure.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
What difference does it make...?
You're sure of that?
That went well.
You sure about this?
Thank you.
Oh no... No you don't.
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
What about the legalities of this...?
What about narcotics?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
How's the patient.
How is she?
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Den leuten.
Do you understand German?
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Why?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Can I hear you?
When...what did you do?
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
Are you going, too?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
They are - private - letters.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Listen, Callaghan.
Next, Paine.
Bring him in.
It wouldn't work.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Well, there's not much time.
I'll look it up for you.
Welcome?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Thank you.
Mr. Lime - yes.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
What else did he tell you?
Should I make it all fact?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
But he has been there, off course.
Did you sleep well?
No.
I think so too.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Too far?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Who the fuck are you?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
People still need values, beliefs....
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Disease? What disease?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
How would you kill him?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
How did you...?
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Which one were you aiming at?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
JTS...?
Are you an artist?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
And what did you do?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
You're leaving?
Did the driver really freeze?
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
Congratulations.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
What was he like, when he was little?
And just where are you from?
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
And where did you say you were from?
I dove 315 feet!
Not at all!
What?
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
He doesn't like us.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
That's good.
You say that because you have the title!
We saw each other a little while ago.
I don't know... why?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
I'd better get back now.
Why?
I didn't dive.
Promise me one thing.
It's my apartment.
Louis, we were French!
Again?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
What do you want me to do?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
Mordechai?
What are you doing here?
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
How do we bypass it?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
They don't say it to me.
I'm sick.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Rosita �� I have wondered -�
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths �� that's what this procession is supposed to be.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
It was you.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter �whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I thought they came right past here ��
Get it out of here!
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ��walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
And I never will- you know what's between us � we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Who was the other man?
It must be the altitude �� you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot�and�saddle boys --
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
What else do you care about, Kicks?
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says �closed to the public�, doesn�t it?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes� majordomo. They are expecting you.
When will they be back?
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
You seem surprised. Could it be you don�t think that badly of him after all?  You needn�t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Excuse me?
Get out of my house. You�re fired, Mr Lombard.
Aren�t you curious to know about Friedman?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Leon hung himself...
Think what you like. But don�t presume to understand.
You bastard...
And you still haven�t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Here we go again.
Should I?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
Get to the point, will you...
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Well, I�d sooner mug an old lady...
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can�t you go back there?
By your Austrian?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we�re doing here?
How come you�re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Thank you. But I think I�ll go to bed. It�s been a long day.
Look, you don�t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn�t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who�s the guy? The Austrian?
Damn it! You can�t fucking walk away from this!
What about your friendly cop?
They�d never let me go. And you�d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Hi...
Yeah.
No... No...  I swear...
Where?
Where are we?
Where are the kids?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Must be your lucky day then. I�ve got your accounts - you don�t owe much tax for last year.
May I...?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard�s address, keys and other things you might need. 
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
The room�s yours for 24 hours. It�s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Anything at all?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Have you?
An Austrian.
I�m sorry...
A private investigator... You�re not Austrian?
Yeah... But he didn�t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent�s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
And you ain�t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Los Angeles?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn�t appeal to you...
Oh. That�d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Who?  I don�t know who the fuck you�re talking about, sunshine.
Why did you kill Friedman?
What�s that? A word?
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
What did the king say?
But it is what I want.
To be killed in battle?
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
I am ready now...
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
No...
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Scared of a girl?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Trial?  What trial??
What did it tell you?
Please... may I have it back...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
So how would you put it?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
His face.
Is it long and hanging down?
That's not a lot.
Wait, wait...
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
We need another ten minutes...
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
And... what does Jeanne think?
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
That's now what I meant...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Why not?  He has good teeth...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Who gave you that horse?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
Why were you yelling like that?!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
They won't come anyway.
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
"Love your enemies"...
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
When's your baby due?
For what? For my tie?
I'm on the run!
What's happened?
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Yes, please.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Pig!
How long have you been here?
You made contact?
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
To be deaf?
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
No.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
We can't leave the piano
Mama.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
How 'bout a handkerchief?
You're late.  Where you been?
What?
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Then why ain't he dead?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
Which one?
They're still looking for him.
What do ya want the others to get?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
Everything go all right?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
How 'bout Lonnegan?
It was too noisy.
You wanta wait for your share?
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
But what about all these other people?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
What the hell for?
What does this guy want?
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
How am I gonna do that?
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
We missed him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
Come on, gimme a break.
He was?
You know how they are... sex...
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Mind if I look around?
You've got to get your mind off this.
Go!
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
You hand that over to the police.
Oh!
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Hello, Dorothy. 
It's been the same one for three months.
You see how much we have to say.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
How's your brother?
But it isn't bad weather now.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
Have you got a pistol permit?
This gun yours?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
No.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Could this be him?
Are you kidding?
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Did you go?
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Goodbye.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
That's ridiculous.
Good morning --
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Don't you remember....
Well, let me do that for you.
What'll I do if something comes up?
But what if you need more money?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
How are you?
Well, don't you?
They'll want more than your word for that.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
What's that?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Want a drink?
You did.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Why don't you?
You bet I wouldn't.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
You worked here?
Bonds, sir?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
He's not so--
We've got rope?
Ready?
Epps!
Maybe we should split it up now.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
What!?  What!?
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
They're not going to--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Where you going?
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
My leg is falling asleep.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Wes might be right about that.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
We'll find our way.
How!?
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Oh, God...
Slip out your M-16.
What do we do?
I don't know!
Can you ride a horse?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
When did you make the switch?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
How do we do that?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
I don't know.
Really?
Woods.
You will.  You'll get it.
Yeah.  So?
Like I said; so?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Oh, God!
What do you think?
Maybe we should give him some water.
You're going to burn up in those.
I can't hear him.
Hurry up.
You know I don't feel well.
Then why did you bring it up?
What time is it?
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
What?
no...no, no.
THX!
What's going on....what are you doing?
THX and me.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
Where is LUH?
I'll report you.  It's....
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
What kind of answer is that?
Yes.
Yes...
They're not here.
Just do it.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Now wait just a fucking-
Treat. We treat devices.
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Hey, look--
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
I terrible with mechanical things.
Where you guys at?
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
What's wrong?
Which one's which?
Right.
"Punks", huh?
You got it.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Prints?
What about the ballistics report?
Oh shit...
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Reilly, Vice. I-
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Yes, sir.
And diamonds in the front.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
You've never been in Constantinople?
Nice day, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Nice suit.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
The fourteenth of May.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Certainly!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
But, Lily--
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
What's wrong now?
Do you realize I have light eyes?
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
It's disgraceful!
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Then riding together.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
I know all your tricks.
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
What is it, madame?
No, m'sieu!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Yes, madame?
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
Rush her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
What do I tell your mother?
You're a good liar.
Almost as good as you.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
You know somebody?
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
Why have we stopped?
How cold?
HELP! HELP!!
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Yes, exactly!
Sure. If you like.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
I don't know the steps.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Now it's worse.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
It's getting quiet.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
You'll excuse me. 
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Could I see you a minute?
I'm so sorry!
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
How about giving me another coat?
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Yes?
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
What?--
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
You don't think--?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
That goes two ways.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
That's too bad.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Next month is June.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
So what?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
I went for four.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
No!
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
There you are, sir.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
I'll explain later--
God damn son of a...
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Come and get him.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
I'm retired.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
But wait, you don't understand-
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Not exactly...
Doc!  How the hell are you?
All right, Doc...
You really look awful.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
What?
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
What is it?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
I have to go.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
Oh, all right.
'Least you admit it.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
I don't like it.
Well how do we look?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
It's that woman from the coach!
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Look pretty rough.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Virgil?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
- We all want what we can't have?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Is that any way to say hello?
His newspapers?
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Happily.
Thanks.  Take care -
Nice to run into you again.
- Shut up!
Do I have to do everything around here?
And what do you call this?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
He was my father's best friend!
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
I am. What do you want?
You won't get away with this!
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
It's Bond!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
I pay my own way.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You must have been really sick.
What happened to your hand?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
Everything these days is made overseas.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Harry, you know everything.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
How is he doing?
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
You invited me.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Whadda ya think?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
That's why.  Sid.
I could have stopped him.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
What?
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Will you quit moving around?!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Hey, Slinky?
There's no mirror.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
I want to go home.
You're not so old yourself!
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
I'm Melanie.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
How much do I pay him?
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Helena --
What?
Me, too.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
You all right?
How's David?
Will we get invited to the White House?
I get A's.  All A's.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
What do you think it is?
No --
You may speak.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
Yeah.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Your new friends.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
Javier Rodriguez.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
What is it you want me to do?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
It could mean that, yes.
My work keeps me young.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
What do you look for?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
Like you protected Landry?
Did you tell him?
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
You've stabbed me, man.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Yes.
So why have you told me about it?
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
What about The Untouchables?
When are you going to visit him?
Fuck you.
How much?
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
What was your price?
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
How's it going with Gail?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
That's fair enough.
Went ballistic?
So what's it going to be?
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
What is it you seek?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
What do you mean?
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
I am here, Captain.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
It would appear we are too heavy.
What is this?
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
The ship needs its Captain.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?


I hide no pain.
I don't understand...
Hi, Alan.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
To warn him.
They'll start to soon enough.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Flynn?
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
You're alive!
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Hey... you guys OK?
How about you?
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
There's another beam!
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
My quarters.
We have to get off this beam!
It's something Users do.
Can you cover me for an hour?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
There's another guy, still in the car.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Any minute now.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Oral hygiene?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
I'm late.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Uh huh.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Natasha?
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
And you've got one.
Beat it.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
I understand.
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Tell me what happened?
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
How come?
What do you want to know?
What's your favorite movie star?
Like it?
Very much. Now, where were we?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
I'm hip.
Live with what?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
That's a pretty amazing story.
Tell me.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
What are we gonna see?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
What?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Who is he?
Keep it.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I've seen him.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Where'd you come from?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
You're no longer an extra -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
- Because it's good!
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
That's him.
What's she doing?
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
What kind of information?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
Underground.
Hiding?
Do you know what year it is?
What year is it?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot!  Who shot you?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
You... you left them a message?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
I need to make a telephone call.
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
Jo...Jose????
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
What?  What did you say?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
He no!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
That a fact?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Nope.  Darrell.
Yep.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Nothing.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
You son of a bitch!
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Open up!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
What do you want?
Who was that on the phone?
Wrong number.
There's someone in the house.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
It's Grace.
Jesus.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
A medicine man?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
You just walk away.
I can't.
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
Shit!
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
John . . .?
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I have half a mind to--
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Where you headed?
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
Like you don't know.
Just ran into a little trouble.
No.
Talk?  About what?
You're talking like a mad man.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
All I have in the world.
Christ, Jake, please--
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
I asked you a question.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
Oz.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
I wasn't doing anything.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Not as bad as it looks.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Hey!  You there!
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Maybe I do.
I think I've heard that before.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
What the fuck do you want?
That's a solid name.
California...
Would I what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You meant it.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
Two-hundred dollars?
But you was going to fight for me.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
But he's dead.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
It's Grace.
What happened to your hand?
Thank you, Bobby.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Are there snakes out here?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Walk away.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Yeah.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
I'm sorry...
Is it pretty?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace ... Grace?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
I'm not sailing his boat.
<u>Jake</u>...
Morning, officer.
Harlin's.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
What'd you say to me!
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
How much?
Heineken?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Son of a bitch!
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Oh.
Is that the entire message?
What does that mean?
Oh shit...
I've come to a decision.
Megan?
...I think rust.
I'm not sure.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
That's not what I witnessed David.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
I'm going to go in.
I'll help you.
No.
How much did you take off?
I see.
I'm not scared.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
He doesn't look very threatening.
No.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Why?
Well, go get it then.
No?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Where'd you get the money, huh?
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
He's coming ain't he?
Free ones?
You want... a free one.
She back in Kansas?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
Yup.
All week?
What's your name?
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
The... Duck of Death.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Jesus!
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Get some sleep, Kid.
Did you kill him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
Yeah?
Take a drink, Kid.
You sure you ain't armed?
Three ways?
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Hullo, paw.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Did you... did you... ?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
We done that stuff.
We'll bury him.
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
They'll never stop.
This is not right.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Why don't you just calm down'
Can we stealth these guys?
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
What the hell do you want?
What fence? Who?
You watch your mouth.
What-are they speaking?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
You're lying.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
Right.
Wait a minute.
Edie.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
Yes.
Very good.
Four cases in three years ...
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
We went to Code Blue...
Well, many reasons, actually...
Well, we...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
It's a crime.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You've just said you signed it.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
Dr. Thompson...?
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
Yes.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
I read the hospital report on your client.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Nothing further, your Honor...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
I...
And what makes you so tough?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
No.
What are you going to do?
I have to talk to you.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
I can't talk now.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I know.  I went ...
... You saw her?
She told me.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Huh.  And why is that?
Should I?
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
No, I'm all right.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Did she hurt herself?
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
It's a place to live, that's all.
I told you! Right here!
Just dinner.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Tomorrow night? Well --
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No? Then what?
No.
Why?!
But Scottie, you don't have to!
They're none of them right.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Ernie's?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Scottie!
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
No! Let me go!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I made it.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Do you remember where you were?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
When?
My name is John Ferguson.
What?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I hope we will, too.
Meet again, sometime.
I don't know.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
I don't like them.
No birds live here.
Yes...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
Why? What's happened?
Yes?! But --
You believe that I love you?
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Ow!!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Uh-huh!
How's your love life, Midge?
That's following a train of thought.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Could be.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Just wander.
Can we have it by tonight?
The stripper's here.
I said how's it going?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
Why was the floor wet?
You're pathetic.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
More.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Have you ever done this before?
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
Fuck you Boyd!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They won't figure it out.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
There is no candy!
Don't ever stare him down.
I know...
I got you.
Don't sweet lip me.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
That's right.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's still working?
She's dead. Call somebody!
What kind of words?
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
Take care of business.
My what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
You're a fucking moron.
Not true.
What? What's your point?
What?
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
This is ridiculous.
What do you mean, you think so?
Caterer?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
He is.
Charles Moore for instants.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
I'm not. What's the problem?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Will you please call the chair people?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
No way.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
What?
Micheal, by accident.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
What?
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Where did you get that?
No...No.
Greenpeace.
That's a good one.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Shut up Micheal.
Two.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
How long are you staying?
Don't you ever see him?
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
Wasn't that cowardice?
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
If you wake first, wake me up.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Well... is it so urgent?
Is she coming back?
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
I'm afraid.
Yes -- very, very big!
Yes!
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
It was very well�hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
You son-of�a�bitch, I'm going to kill you.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
I've seen worse.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re�assignment.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
What did you find out?
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
I haven't been working on anything.
... and you get nano�death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Enjoying yourself?
What's the problem?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
You're not capable of it.
Where's John?
You and me have nothing in common.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you��
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
It's the White House.
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Who's got the story? 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
When do we bring'em back?
What would do that...?
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
...this's <u>good</u>...
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Oh, Lord....
How's your wife?
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Heavy weather East of here.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
How much...?
Do I know you?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
What do you think would hold it off?
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
I never won an Oscar.
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
I think it's fine?
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
...that's right.
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Watch me.
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Shoes, Hats....
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
Yes.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Jim Belushi...?
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
Yes. 
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Please, no thanks... 
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
...well, see him?
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
What brings you out here...
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
...I can't even see it...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Hello Bud.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Weird and tiny huh?
Yes, I guess you're right
Thank you Jenkins
Jenkins!
What?  Tony and China, together?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well divide 18 into three
Sell my soul?
Can this be stopped?
They're all human beings
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Of course you will.
That's not true.
Are you mad at me?
I miss you.
So much.
No.  But once I heard...
What?
Why is he worried?
Fireball?
Are you humoring me?
You think you influenced her?
Yes?
When...when will she be back?
Tell me.  Please.
That's not...It's not like that.
You do?
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
And then you weren't there.
Thank you.
You look a little old for a student.
Wow.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
...just so she could cut them off.
You should have heard her play.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
How you holding up?
What is it?
It's niiice.
Know what I think?
Telling you...
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Sit down here.
Something was there.  You saw it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Oh God...you knew.
I'm a terrible friend.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Claire?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
Not the focus.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Tomorrow.
Did she say that?
What kind of whispering?
Yep.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
What?  No.  No.
He killed her.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
See?
What am I looking at?
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
I'm sorry...
What?
I...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
You should have tried harder.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Huh.
Shhhh.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
Two what...?
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
uh - then he - be just -
It is from love.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Yessss...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
My jury's still out on that,
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
What do you see...?
The one time I want it to work...
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Hello..
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
What were you talking about...?
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
Stop it!
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
He's got great hands.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
This must be one of the old keys -
Do you take sugar?
No she didn't...
I don't know...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
then why did you marry her -
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
Just put it in my room
Were you always this sick?
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
What is it now?
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You're late, bro!
Get them together.
These are real, live women?
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Son.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Yeah.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Is this an gritty expos� or a candy ass press release?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Well? Where the hell are you?
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Tell me more.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I see.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Do you trust me, Julie?
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Like what?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
You called the cops on us?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You saw the news today?
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Will you do me one favor?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Where's this coming from?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Ms. Toller?
A ride.  You want one?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Hi, Mon.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
So, where you off to now?
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Hello.
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
But she ran away.
You mean this thing?
No.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Prepare what?
You feeling all right?
What was all that back there?
Jim, are you all right?
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
And people are actually fooled by that?
When we find him, he is mine.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Yes sir.
Good work.  Really.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Who was this partner of his?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
This is something.
You left me to die, friend.
You managed alright.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Why not?
Sorsha.
He's no magician.
We're a tiny version of all that?
You all right?
Are you a warrior?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Time to change her diaper.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
You?
You?
No.
What's the magician's weapon?
How??
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
She needs to be changed.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Who??
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Maybe milking.
John, I don't understand any of this.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Is it them?
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Yeah.
You know who?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
What was that?
They kid a lot.
Oh? Anything else?
Does anybody know I'm here?
Enjoying your reading?
Hochmut?
I'm going this morning.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Sure.
When will you be going?
I was being foolish?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's God's way!
Where's my baggy pants?
Anybody know about this?
Johnny, what the fuck?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Is the English dead?
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
No --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
If she...
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
...resourceful!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Whenever you wish.
How did you guess?
That's our farm!
...bed.
Now you're seeing reason.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Did you say something?
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
And bears!
Oh, he's just ascared again.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh, my!
Yes -- let's run!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Because I'm still scared!
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Did I scare you?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
Real courage. That's what we want.
Who at?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
Somebody pulled my tail.
I -- Oh --
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
It makes you nervous?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Stop that dog!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Elektra King.
The King pipeline.
We�ve got to get out.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won�t just be two weeks out of action.
It�s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Who told you to look at Elektra�s files?
I was the one who brought that money in...
I�m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Who?
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
They�re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can�t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
No!  It will cave in!
I don�t want to be safe!
If this little show is for my benefit, I�ll take you home right now.
How did you survive?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I�m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather�s name, the glory of my people.
One... last... screw?
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat�s nest.
See?  You�re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
And the payoff on the tables?
Wrong answers?
A whore fucking.
I'm here, Laurie.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
Who?
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
His . . . whatever.
Laurie --
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
I think he's going to the john.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Dan -- what do we do now?
Coward.  Giving up.
We should get back --  What?
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Why is that?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
The scum of the Earth.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
I was invited. What's your story?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Go to hell!
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Yorgi and Kirill.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
I can see that. Why?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Dude, what are you doing here?
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
He's uptight.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
The intention of registration act -
What do you want?
He helped you?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Frederick Frankenstein?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
What was your grandfather's name?
Yes, sir.
Carlson!
Yes, sir?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Miss me?
Of course.
You have your tickets?
Yes, don't worry.
Very....very!
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Fron kon steen!
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
I beg your pardon?
There wolf!  There castle!
What are you doing here?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
How's everything?
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Would you like a sandwich?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Oh, Doctor!
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
I think so.
Yes, I know.
His schwanzstucker.
Four
Yes.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
