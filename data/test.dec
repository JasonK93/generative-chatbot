I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Tons
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
They do not!
Is he oily or dry?
Hopefully.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Daddy, no!
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Get out!
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
No, I ' m not.
Then, go get her
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Where?
What do you think?
Fine, thirty.
What?
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
Just a little.
Does it matter?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Who?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
Hi

That's what you want, isn't it?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
You 're so --
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Good call.
I dazzled him with my wit
You never disappointed me.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Why not?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
No -- impressed.
When I go?
Right.
Touch of the flu.
Dr. Ruth?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We'll all go crazy...
If they agree to follow me, yes.
I don't want you to wait for me.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
May I ask by whom?
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
I'm not bargaining!
... for a commoner?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We don't need to know.
My horse doesn't work.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Then why?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
No, he is here.  Shit...
What's your cut?  How much?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Yes, but he was a cop.
No.
What about back home?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Go on.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Yeah, right.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Who says she's a suspect?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Raw deal.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Hey.
Stop it.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Answer the phone.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
See you later.  Good luck.
I'm not moody.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Yes.
He doesn't speak English.
We have no money.  Come on.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
You said speak Czech!
Shut up.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
In love?  With who?
I want to hear everything he said.
Alright.  Go ahead.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
I used an accelerant.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
He knew all along.
You hear that question, Garcia?
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Two more.
Roger.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
In three days, darling, I hope.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
I see.
Certainly.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Opening pod bay doors.
Whaddya mean, buy?
I never paid for it in my life.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
That's never been one of my problems.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
What about Ganz?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
I didn't have the time.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
When? How?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I guess he got the message...
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Hiya, kid.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Shut up.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Five bills.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Yes. Of course..
Hey bud! Finger here.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...Leeloo.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
What mission?
Just one... why me?
You're the only one left alive...
I'm not going.
Uh..you're welcome.
Cornelius..
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
To fame.. salud..
How's our deal coming along?
Your clothing reeks of it.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What?
I'll consider it.
Machine.
Look, I don't know what this...
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Any good?
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
Yeah.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
It was a lot of fucking money.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Because we're going there.
What did you do with her body?
Fuck you!
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
I'm asking.
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Pardon me?
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Three, four years.
I'm not a cop.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
A daughter.
You're learning.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
It's their Presidential Suite.
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
It won't work like that.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
How will I get it to you?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
What was she running from?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
No...
Yes.  I remember her.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Okay.  Fine.
Then we'll stay up together.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
"In her dream"?
Kristen's story really got to her.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
You just feel sorry for me.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Enough of that crap.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Yeah...I guess.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Had kind of a long night.
No, the Dan part was nice...
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
So did Dan.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
My baby!
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Yeah...
Two hours a day, six days a week.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
So?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Listen!  Hear that?
Anything ---
There's got to be an explanation!
I met Dr. Kent, once.
Who with?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
What?
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
- for horrors like yourself?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Toward the Pole!
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Chub says you're fired.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Damn straight!
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You might not kill it.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Sun's gettin high.
Not here.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
How'd you get the job?
I just think you used to be bad.
No.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Jesus, why?
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
It belongs to Pop.
What do you want, then?
Okay.
Fine.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Where's the plow?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Could be.
See. Get your boots.
For a while.
Forget it.
Okay.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
Think they're alright?
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
Is...? She's dead then?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
What?
This town sucks.
He got his deer yet?
You think Jack shot him?
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
A hunting accident is perfect.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Jim... for godsake!
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Been better, Dad... You?
Did we warn them off?
Got it.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
To swear you in as President.
Because it is my duty.
why did they do that?
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
My husband is a very courageous man.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Jim...
Gravity.
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Yes, sir.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Commissioner.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Ask Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted!
That was very well put, Ted.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
Can't we change course?
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
He's carrying a bomb.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Yes.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
The gear is down.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
Yeah...
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Did you learn anything?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
How potent?
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
We can't let him get away.
For you, anything.
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Position?
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
She's right.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
Now, wait a second --
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Not that tunnel, the other one!
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Let's get these things lit.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
We didn't miss anything.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Just get back here!
They're dead.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Yes.  A little girl.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Indeed.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
In a harem.
Why?
What?
What??
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I want to go back to Vienna.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Yes!
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
No!
Well, ask her!
Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Then he didn't send you?
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Tonight?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
You can't be Herr Mozart!
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
May I try it?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Yes?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Oh?
Of course not.
I think so, Sire, yes.
Yes, indeed.
And German?
What is it?
Who told you this, Majesty?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
I have no idea.
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Is she not here?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Don't you have a maid?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Mine?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Good morning, sir.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Yes what?
Are you Herr Mozart?
Wolfi!
Put it down!
Yes.
Why not?
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
What exactly are you working on?
I can't say. Really
But what is it they don't like?
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
Did my work please you?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Would you? Actually, you could.
Of course.
Strange!
I think so.
Show me.
Yes.
I'm not leaving you.
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Taking out what you should never have put in.
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Baron!
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
All Vienna has heard that.
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
You must be mad.
Where?
Excuse me, my dear.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
Dr. Hirsch?
No, why?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Aw come on, Alex!
I thought you were asleep.
Shall I read to you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
A werewolf?
Bathroom.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Where am I?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
She says she 'likes me too much'.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
Heathcliffe.
Let's just keep walking.
Walk away, Jack.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
David!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm not listening!
What?!
Get out of here, Jack!
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
Oh.
I beg your pardon?
You here again? What do you want?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
What do you mean, help?
We've been waiting fifteen minutes�
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she�
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
I'm sorry, Dude, but�I�
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
Well, what?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Cyril!
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
A misunderstood bachelor.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Oh, yeah?
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Got a handkerchief?
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Yes, sir.
You haven't got a uniform?
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why pick on him ?
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Well . . . ?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Yes, why?
Yes, sir.
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
No. It wasn't earlier because...
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
There you are!
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
wasn't anywhere near this place�
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Okay, Matt.
You stay out of this, Bob.
I ain't done --
He's not bad at it.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
Yeah.
Sure, cousin.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
I got us through the War all right.
Where is Jesse James?
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
The District Marshall
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
It's fine by me, Jesse.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Maybe, maybe...
You are a charmer.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
What do you think?
You've killed your fair share of men.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
What?
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Where will you find such a girl?
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
"Hmm" what?
Stop it. This is just sad.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
I figured.
And the same age Web was. No.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Don't talk about it much, though.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
They had to be dealt with!
Really!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Good.
Yes sir.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I look forward to seeing it.
This is no game.
It is a nice piece of writing.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
In English, Pinkerton.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Yes?
Do you take American Express?
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Evelyn?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
But what about the past? Our past?
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
But where?
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Patrick?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Oh really? That's great.
When?
Just say no?
You didn't give them a name.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Hmmmm.
What are I doing?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
A model? An actor?
Uh huh?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, really. I'm okay.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Who do you ask?
Well...
Yale thing?
Oh.
What?
Suit yourself, I guess.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I'm hungry.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
You are a fanatic.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
...But?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Milo! What about --?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
What're you -- what?
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Right... What's that mean again?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
What?
Is it your dish?
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Did you?
Sure.
'Sorry about the late notice...
You see what's hanging on the wall?
What?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
But why would they --?
Oh yeah?
They'd frame him.
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Oh.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Why?!
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Let's try #2.
Is that how Larry feels?
Uh. Not exactly.
What?!
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Groovy.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Yes?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Yes?
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
My mother's told me all about you.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
My wedding tackle.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
Here, use mine.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
Go! Just go!
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
No, did you use a condom?
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Are you crazy?
I'll secure the perimeter.
Sure.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Sea bass.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Not me.
An evil petting zoo?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
What did you say?
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
We don't judge here.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
... love...
Fear ...
Peter ...
Three days.
Have we met?
I have an appointment.
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Rules are made to be broken.
We want to help...!
So am I.
Too many cooks --
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
I'm already married ...
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
I'll never marry you.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
I meant me.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
As far as you trust me.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
You'll find out.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Have a look at this.
But --
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Peter's brother?  But --
I know all this.
Surveillance? By whom?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Impossible.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
I was at Harrow ...
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Yeah. What is it?
You're kidding.
Women!
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Keep me informed.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Ilene, are you crazy?
What's going on?
I didn't know you were into that.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Ha, ha, ha.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Feel free.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
C'mon. I insist.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
What, you've never seen one before?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Yeah... too bright...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Just leave me alone, okay?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
How do you know?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Homey.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
I was doing my job.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
I don't know anything about it.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
I don't have the slightest idea...
The outlets.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
Did I say thanks?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Backdraft.
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Here we go...
Fixing my roof.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
You treated me like shit.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
And old ladies?
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
Investigator Rimgale.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Who?
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
I want 15 on the Mets.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
This psycho can.
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
Yes, Sister?
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
Let's go NIGGERS.
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
Who are you revolting against?
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Must be the pressure.
Look at my lips.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm out.
Damn skippy.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
And I'm the feet.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
It's me, Peerless.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
I'm in till the end.
This is Cheeba.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Just don't lie to me.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
You sound like the media.
In time.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Regardless, he still is your father.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Maybe you need to start.
Y'know what?
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
O'Grady.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
And he doesn't care about me?
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Shut up, Mueller.
We don't know. West is dead.
It's... too slow.
What do you like then?
They're dead, aren't they?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
I'm serious --
Yeah --
Do what?
What business?
I...
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Look in my pack.
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
What happened to "degrees"?
No. Poetic justice, though.
Stop.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
I didn't do anything --
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
The Senator...
That's preposterous --
He's in interrogation?
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
The very same.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
What point?
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
But you will.
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
No.
Good, just making sure.
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Nah.
What are you talking about?
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
So you took off your shirt?
Because he'd shot Mueller.
We've been making progress, I see.
You can't threaten me --
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
What the fuck are you doing?
The fuck are you talking about --
Then it's unofficial.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Edward Bloom.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Then do it.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Eighteen.
How did you know?
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Lucky girl.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Can I take your picture?
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Yes.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
It would kill you, huh?
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Go out with me.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Because he's dying.
You didn't become crazy.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I'll help you.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
Probably tonight.
Did you?
He's up with your father.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
So you never bought any land.
Such as?
Yeah.
No I haven't.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
And...
Right.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Tell me what he said.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Happy bath day.
In the world.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Okay we won't talk about it.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
I got what I paid for.
You didn't mind too much.
Get out
I wasn't saying anything.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's alive?
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Please.
Tell me about it.
Thanks.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Okay.
For your hands?
You been home yet?
Stop what?
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
I keep the heat on.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
Uh-uh.
Itches.
Uh-uh.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
We drinkin' buddies now?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Nothin'.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
What I love.
Huh?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
I didn't start this, R.L.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
What's on your mind?
Yeah, I know.
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Thought you had a man for that.
Thanks.
Let go...
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
In Rome, I'll bow.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
I don't, that's all.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I'm sorry.
How can you be so sure?
There was a change in plans.
Tell them I'm not.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
This by this...
Yeah.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
He was my partner.
It is not allowed.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Look.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
You certainly have a nice place here.
I am?
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
I was just about to have my dinner.
Yeah.
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
What about a summary then.
And what in your estimation works?
Next.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
I like you too.
I don't know.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Sorry.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Nope.
Can I come in?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Does it eat?
It would be my child.
I think you need more help than you've got.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Ten years.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
What?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Sitting next to you.
Don't move.
Just better.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
Your mom was a dancer?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
My office.
Young man, stop right there!
No, you get out of here.
You're lost?
Yes, I'm right?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
I guess we'll need another locker.
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Name it.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
I don't want to be alone.
Two weeks.
You said it would be easy!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Uh...yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Look unimpressed.
Not that one!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
I'm sorry.
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Thanks.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
...I do.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
...the pipe tobacco.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
I'm not wearing his pants.
I just don't want to.
I LOVE THIS!!
Of what?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Thirty-five.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Hi.
Yes, ma'am.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
No.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
What shall we call him?
If I...you know...
If he tells, it won't come true!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Just open the door.
Yes! That's right!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Excuse me.
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Yes, dear, I know.
Well, that's blunt!
That's what I'm sensing.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
Always good advice.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Uh, yes, you do.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Buy it from me?
Stand by. One.
Roger, Wolf One.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Yes sir.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
THEN WHAT?
Yes.
No. What is happening?
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
No. I should go.
I sure don't hate you.
Whatiya mean?
Yes.
I asked first.
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
He's comin' back? What for?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
On a ride.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
Well. Okay.
Alright.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Are you feeling okay?
It's good to see you, Dad.
Am I bothering you?
That's too bad.
Maybe so.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Okay, okay.
You want to go talk to him?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
NO.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Aye.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
I-I'll tip her.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We paid attention in school.
Know any other languages?
Our mother can see through bags.
Aye.
Okay. We're ready.
Italian.
What?
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
How do you figure?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Sicilians.
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey Murph.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Well, I'm sold.
Y-Yes my son.
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
What do you want me to say?
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Yeah, I saw it.
That sets it off.
Yeah, I heard that.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
There's another stocker, right?
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
I don't want to use it.
Look at the treads on those.
True.
Inez, this is --
As long as he gets out OK.
Maybe he just went to the store.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
I'm not. But there's --
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
What the fuck are we doing out here?
It's like we've finally arrived.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
We all set?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Nobody move!
What?
Dignan, I --
That's a sharp jacket.
So do I.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Take a deep breath.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Let them fight.
What was that?
Move.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
No, I don't mind.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
It was stupid.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Uh-uh.
Abdul-Shabazz?
What do you mean?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
True.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
My brother.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
So it's my fault?
See you in a little while.
What are you talking about?
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Yes, I do.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
That's OK.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
This is no good.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Fight. You know.
Come on in!
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
Don't know.
The sooner the better.
Keep going...
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Yes...
Look at me.
-- take the back -- get another car --
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
Where --
We can't wait to be sure.
-- not yet --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
Tell me later.
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
So when was I here?
My first job.
That's a lie!
Who?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
And the Germans can't match it?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
Peace?!
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
Scotland. He intends --
Fourteen? --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
I do not confess.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
...Tonight!
It's battle I want, not talk.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
So what did you find.
You know the answer to that.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Are you hurting her?
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
Go on. Sit down.
What do you mean?
I get it. You can drop it now.
Ha! Where's that?
Because you're... different.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Know what?
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I thought I was the bad guy!
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
And you want to know --
A champagne cocktail, please.
Goodnight.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Er, my check, please.
Practically no one.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
I will.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Put them on the table.
And Laszlo?
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Of course, I'll be careful.
He came from Paris with Rick.
What for?
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Right.
What of it?
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Very well.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
And that is?
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Perhaps.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
This is the end of the chase.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
You think of everything, don't you?
I think perhaps you're right.
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Yeah, boss?
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Oh?  You've tried?
You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
You?  Personally?
Must be a story there.
You don't seem too happy about it.
I can't even keep fish alive.
Could you watch Jango?
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
What was inside?
That about sums it up.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
I'm doing fine.
I wanted to come here.
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
Forty-three days.
Believe me I know.
Life is waiting.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
I'm *not* a doctor!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
Just a little privacy.
It will be okay.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
He's *paralyzed*!
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
It's all very normal.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
The Anti-Christ?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
And these cops? What do they get?
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Let's go, Jake?
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
She's up for it.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
I'd like this cashed, please.
You can't cheat an honest man.
I think two million.
No thanks. I'm good.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Good boy.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
Just play a part. A little acting.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Don't worry about it.
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
What?
Lighten up.
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Glenn talked you out of it.
You sure we're clear?
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Miles...
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
We're getting a little old for running.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Keep it up.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Pretty much.
So what do you want?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
My car's in the garage.
Why did you quit?
Not like Matt, you mean.
South African women are very sporty.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
I won't be that long.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Why not?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
You will?
Never. Why do you ask?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Just an accident. Nothing.
What kind of trouble?
The point is, they want a man inside.
But if it does.
What about my neck?
I can't do it, Jani.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Yes.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Did you solve your problems?
Who did it? Tell me!
She's my baby.
How long have you worked at the casino?
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
I don't gamble.
Don't worry.
Give me 365.
Good call.
What for?
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, there's the possibility of...
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Thanks.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
Oh, sure.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Yeah?
Who's Camille?
Police drone.
Don't look down.
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
When?
First time I ever heard that.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Look, I don't know what you want--
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
No.
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
And because he's my friend.
Exactly.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
I'll give it my best shot.
Say the words, "I understand."
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
No, I mean... you love your son?
Yeah, a man's drink...
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
No...
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Yeah.
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Beg pardon?
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
Donnie! Give it back!
Where did you come from?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why do they call you Frank?
How much longer is this gonna last?
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Fuck them.
What makes you think I'm not?
Wonder where we'll be then.
That was a compliment.
Who?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
The whole movie. Let's go.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
I don't own a television.
He said to follow him.
Follow him where?
No.  That's stupid.
What else do you think about during school?
Four times... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
No. That makes you keep searching.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
But you were punished.
Regret.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
I think now that he might...
Where are we going?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Frank?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
How did this happen?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
She's right over there.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Huh?
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Shut it up, Loretta.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
They told me to practice.
My dress'll reek.
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
The bitch.
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Nothin' too showy!
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
All right, let's go.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Uh, Gladys?
I will if you shut your piehole.
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
They think I should - They think I should - They think I should - They think I should be king.
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Take a letter...
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
Half watch dog?
What do you whistle?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
He only weighs ten ounces --
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
That's not bad for any day.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Sure.
It must be done right away.
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Why -- why -- of course.
You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
WHAT  ?
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
I've always thought that myself.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
Well, these things take time.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
I found it.
I'll get my bag.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
You don't own this man!
Good morning, sir.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Well, yes.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
John Merrick.
Thank you very much.
Ohhh...
Not at all, John.
Good morning.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Yes, John.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Fine.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Welcome home, John.
Ah! It's my father!
Who, Father?
There IS no one.
Those things in your hands.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
But you LOVED her all the same...
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
Why?
The second note to wake the Gods...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Well... isn't it great?
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
You've got to let me go!
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Yes... oh, yes...
The important thing is not to panic.
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I didn't mean to!
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
What a stupid idea.
What?
ROW!
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Well, come on!
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What are you talking about?
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I have to go...
Bye... sorry...
Do what?
No, it is NOT.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
Can't make enough swords!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
How can we stops him now?
She knows it was our fault!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
You liar!
Me too.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Yes, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
I never do...
Yeah, you told me that later.
No one.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You know Wilmont?
What?
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
No.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
Would you get me another, Joely?
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Oh?
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
I know.
yeah?
Yeah, maybe.
Um, no.
It's freezing out here.
I think we should go.
What if you stay this time?
Oh, um...
That's okay. I --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Your dried cum.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
In a minute.
I hope you get your work done.
We'll speak soon.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Hi.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yup.
You better go.
I swear.
Hi.
I know what it is.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Maybe after the holidays then.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
I know who you are.
Siwash, huh?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
That's your problem.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
For magazines?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Yep.
I'm the best.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
I'll get him.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
You're okay now, it's over...
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
No.
Go on.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
...you okay?
Thanks.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
The Core...!
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Watch me.
Then who the fuck are you?
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
They're gone.
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
Blow it up?
He served on the Goliath.
They're explosive charges.
Can you shut it down?
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Ship's log.
Claire is your wife?
It means nothing.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
About me? How sweet.
Baby, you're scaring me.
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Give me a mirror...
Go back to the drawing board.
So are you!
What about you?
Okay, "mom."
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Great minds think alike.
Of course. Of course.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Skeptical...?
You want to work at Carl's?
On the ledge?
There it is!
Your friends use the pool too.
Well... it's true.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Okay, Dennis.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Oh, really?
What a guy.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Did you get her number?
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Really.
No Damone. I don't understand.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
That's me, Merv.
Then don't hassle it.
My brother is gonna shit.
Do you think that guy's cute?
I can't do that.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
Believe it.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
There's nothing to it.
It was okay.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Not since November.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
No. But it's a nice idea.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
What class?
I don't know.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
What about those other guys you live with?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Sure.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Lacerda?
He told me he was turning in early...
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
Are you ready?
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Lucy is looking for you.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Right!
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
We can't risk letting them in.
Right.
There's a tunnel.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
You weren't helpin'.
Your parents of relation?
Oh.
Really?
Okay then.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Is it gassed up?
Covered.
Keys.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
No shit.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
She's not very nice, is she?
And the last one is the...
Wait God-dammit!
That's one piece of four problems.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Why... yes.
Don't touch me.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
I just wanted to see how you looked.
How'd I look?
Enh.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
What for?
I'll bet.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Who said I was a lady?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
You can't drink.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Will you marry me?
Frances, You're crazy.
I hope so, Frances.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
No.
That would be okay.
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
The speech? Real good.
You got it.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
You kill me, Mama.
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
At one. Promise?
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
Mama, shut up!
I will, I promise.
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
People can be kinder than you think.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
I see it before me.
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
And you look so lovely.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Nothing can. Not ever.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
God took her from us.
All my life I've known.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I will be here when you return.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Somebody has to!
I've been preoccupied.
Is that your diagnosis?
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Despite the lack of challenge.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
I heard.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I finished the boats.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
Un-hunh.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
No, they won't...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Don't get up. Take a second...
Dancer.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
I guess...
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Yeah.
The truth hurts.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Jacob.
How'd she die?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Didn't like it, did ya?
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
In the Winnebago.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Scott?
Everybody goes home!
You asked me if I would --
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Six-fifty.
I wasn't scratching!
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
You believe me don't cha?
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
-- This conversation is over.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
What?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Just some of the women.
Don't say my name.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Of course, but there's more --
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Did you hear?
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
You'll think about my offer?
Then I suggest we start there.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Which is guy-speak for...
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Just askin'
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Should I be afraid?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
North?
MOVE!
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Only one way to find out.
But we can get to the west side faster.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Can I use some?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
I don't think so.
I'll try.
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
That is our job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
Thanks.
We've met before.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Where's my bed?
Thanks.
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
I played Richard III...
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Excuse me guys.
Yes but, we were wondering-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
What does the Omega 13 do?
How did you come to that conclusion?
That's It?
Never mind, Fred....
Your last name.
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
Only answers to me.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
We pretend...
We.. We lie.
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
But there it is!...
But...Why?
And determination.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
Oh god...
How about the pig-lizard?
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Therefore, retreat.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Lafayette is a child!
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I understand, George.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
And how rusty are these muskets?
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
Some things must never change.
We're leaving them?
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
That's a lie!
Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Or, 'civilized'.
Let's get you darker!
That's good... who?
That land belongs to the strongest.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
I guess still in the locker.
About sixty.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
He's around someplace.
You can talk to me.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
That's all there is to it, huh?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
That's the magic number.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
Not really.
For a movie?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
You don't even know these guys.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
It was in the Herald.
Ask your man here.
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
One of mine?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
Martin, look at me.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
How'd you know I was here?
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I'll find you, Leo...
How much is the wife offered?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
I don't know.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Come on in.
Harry -�
Shylock?
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey �-  This your ride, Chili?
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
No.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Bring it on, dude.
Or uninvited guests.
Gimme a break.
Right. Wednesday.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How long?
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
It looks like it.
Yeah, yeah.
Why not? Why the fuck not?
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
So whoever did this might still be around.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
What do you propose?
For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
I think you know.
Then you're a lucky man.
I bet you did.
That's what I call a payday.
Because of the gold.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Who?
You just shoot at something?
Greer?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
Collision? With what?
If it was a ship she hit.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
What happened.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
I don't know.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
What do you say, Dodge?
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
And look what happened.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Who?
YES.
Yup.
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
About what?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
But I was only trying to be friendly...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
Yeah, well... hi...
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Did you sign up yet?
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
I remember every minute of that party.
We should follow him home.
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
What are you talking about?
It's always closed...
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
Let's go hassle Josh.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Everybody's too stupid!
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
You cunt!
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Don't worry.
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I need to talk to you.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
That's all you're bringing?
It just came yesterday...
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Wow!
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Good luck...
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I really didn't get a good look at her.
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
"Yet."
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
Sounds good...
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
What's up?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
So where would we go?
I dunno, I...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Yeah, well... me neither...
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
I don't know.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
There is no reason for fear.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
I think it's been a pleasure.
How; we don't know where they are?
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
And it worked?
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
John, it will not be easy.
That's what the books say... 
You mean nobody died?
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Have you ever failed?
Only in life... 
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
You've known him long?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I won't.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
-- the sorrow --
So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
Who are they?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
All right, what happened to me?
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Yeah, yeah.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I think I should spend the night here.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
You're the best one in your row.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
But why?  The students love us!
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Die in what sense?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Great!  How's it going?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Why do you want to see it?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
Yes.  I don't like this.
Two wavy lines?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
What do you mean "bad?"
She said he was "the Destructor."
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
No sense worrying about it now.
It's not good, Pete.
Who was the architect?
I don't think it's Shandor.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
What is that... wailing?
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Take grain away from the army?
Jerses -- tomorrow...
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Servis made it through again?
They fear me.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Of course...
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Alive... I'm alive...
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Before they leave, get gold.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Yes.
I'd love some.
No.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I just want to tell you something.
But could you try?
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Don't cry. 
But you're not enrolled.
My belt.
Oh.
No.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
No.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
It's in the main ballroom.
What?
What?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
My husband will be back quite late.
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
It's all right.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Yes?
Why is it?
Oh my God.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
The number.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
What?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Who said it was my first time?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Go ahead then.
He's asleep.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Well I can't.
Art.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Oh my God.
No.
Good.
Let's drop it.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
You wouldn't.
Of course I wouldn't.
But if it's sickening for you --
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
What the hell have you done?
Goodnight, sir.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
What else?
You don't?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
To be what?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Yes.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
You miss the point.
Yes?
Splendid!
The pearls are in her room.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
No --
You can't.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Reducing?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Very little.
Free --
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Money.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Anything for you.
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
Just for a minute then.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
What is the matter?
So --
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Don't.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
I must have made a mistake.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
No, doctor.
What, Doctor?
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Tired?
I got ten marks for that.
With the same friend?
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Tomorrow morning.
Nothing.
Oh, yes.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Exactly.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
Shhh -- here he is now.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
Mop rags --!
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Yes --
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
You see -- what we are interested in --
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Again?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
No. No word.
Good night.
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
You know it, Lilly.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Lead on.
Perk.
Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
I guess I owe you my life.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Sure.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Well, that's good news.
Never.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Let's find out.
Roy? It this all we have?
No more than this?
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
That's just Lilly's way.
I've heard the name.
And when he got serious?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Yeah? How?
He retired.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Take a hike, you mean?
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
She didn't see you, in other words.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Yes?
Gun?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Yes.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
My god...
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
No shit.
Yes.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
That would work.
What?
What are you looking at?
Are you going to leave, too?
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Thanks!
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
But I've seen him!
You can't expect us to stay here --
Promise?
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
You stay away from him!
He's gone.
Jamie's baby ...
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
Hm?
A bitch.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
How short the skirts are.
Let's talk about something else.
Sorry.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I forget mine for years on end.
Pass the fucking catsup.
To make an ass of yourself.
Out!  Out!
Thank God!
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
She has a master's degree in English literature.
Mhravitch.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Go on.
Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Sir?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Who was it?
Open the bolt!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
What do you do for a living?
You used to like it stark!
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
You're wrong.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Such as?...
It's a big and busy funeral home.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Just one favor.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Sounds quite beautiful.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
What a handsome word.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
I mean it!
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Load it for her.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
Out!
Hello, Mother.
We'll miss you so.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
I came back.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Hundreds.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
I'm utterly satisfied.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
Don't shoot.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Alice is dead?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
I dunno.
Premature ejaculation.
That is sad.
Don't worry about it.
Don't!
He's alive!
You're the only woman he ever took out.
A lot of people don't.
That man is your father.
What?
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
What does he say to do?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
My father!
Don't worry about it.
That's something I suppose.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Far as I know.
Is he coming home?
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
I'm sorry.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
She quit this afternoon.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
What kind of a life is that?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
It's suicide!
Why would you do that?
We've got to rescue him.
We met here earlier this evening.
It's really that bad?
Is that a fact?
Or get eaten alive.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
You mean I'm black?
But is she, has...
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
What are you doing?
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
Pull out your cock.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
I don't know no Tod.
What girls you got here?
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
She's dead.
What rate?
Is that the way it was with you?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
What do you care about?
What the crap?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
What makes you so sure?
Granville?
I can't tell you that.
Where is he, Niki?
In G.R.? Why?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I don't know.
Where did you get that film?
I don't know.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Take it or leave it.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Sounds all right.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
I don't know.
What's that?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Oh, I don't have one.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Your tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
No, thank you. I have my car.
No.  I thought not.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
It's very interesting.
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
That's a nice teapot.
Because they are all the same.
What is it?
Yes.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Well, I don't...
What was that?
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Well, they're my species.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.
At a funeral.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
Can't complain.
Just give me a rough estimate.
Huh?
Your classmates?
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
Why?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Yes, sir.
You think so, sir?
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Eh?
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Well, I didn't.
Time to play.
You knew?
I know.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
If anyone can help, HE can.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
WHY?
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Oh, right --
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
I think that is its hand.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
Who?!
I knew those men better than you did --
You call that thing a cigar??
Myers?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What -- ?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Two steps back, please.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
You did this before, right?
No. That wasn't the deal.
You want it?
Poor baby.
I said: don't look.
What do you want me to do.
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Good.
You're hurting.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Later.
Hell...
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
Which is where?
What's the problem?
Of course. There's no need to shout.
Like who?
Just a thought --
Oh Christ. Julia...
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
No you won't.
I'll be down in a minute
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
That's right.
What's wrong?
Where are you?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
O.K.
Yeah.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
It's like she's waiting for something.
He's gone.
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
Yes!
If there's a train.
I see.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
No, it's good to see you.
Can I lend you a hand?
What did I say?
Sure. Why not?
'Bye.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Oh, so what's the point then?
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
None.  Christ!
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
So?  You even said they're good.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
NO--!
He's not worth it!
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Oh.  Okay.
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
No, that's okay.  Really.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Think about it, Rob.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
My house?
But don't you remember?
I don't know.
No.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Yeah.  Great.
I don't know.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
I don't have your number.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Sure they are.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
But what?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
You're tougher.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
About what?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Thank you.
Yup.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Nor have you!
Right.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
Naw.  Those are for us.
Fuck off.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
It's my birthday.
Thanks.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Probably.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You?
You're a fool.
Maybe.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
Why are you here?
You killed those other two.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it you want?
You and I should talk first.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
We are brothers.
We are immortal.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
I am not ready for this.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
I have no future husband.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
Some think not.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Yes, he was.
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
You were never a kid.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
MACLEOD!
It's all we have.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
American.
You're wrong.
All I need is time.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
Oh yes, more than enough.
His only kid.
No.
Just your pappy scared some.
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Fine.
I don't blame them.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Now you got me.
Thanks.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
What do you mean?
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Huh!
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Then why are you doing it?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Sure.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Walter, you can't do that!
It'll be Heaven!
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Yeah. But I --
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
I was just going to!
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
My name is Louis Peluso.
I'm telling you!
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Mother!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
Very simple, Earl.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
What do you mean?
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Who do you think!
For heaven's sake, why not?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
A very fine-looking women.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
What's that?
Bloody.
Ask her yourself.
You do it. You're a girl.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
Well, for the baby, really.
The sodding water table.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
They might be.
Where?
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Bugger the Buffs.
I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
How are we going to cope?
Wasn't it lovely?
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Baby! Stop!
Couple more miles up this road.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
The Duke?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
But if you did.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Yeah, no shit.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Perfect.
How awesome?
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
What I need are some answers. 
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
That kid is one horny retard.
What?
How's he get around out here?
So.
When you were outside with Bill.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
Shhhhhh.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
Not yet.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
I was just kidding.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Please, just a minute.
Who's your Daddy!
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
What.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Unnhh.
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
I've moved on.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
But I like being human now.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
My brother says he likes you, too.
And I think I'm going to.
Oh, Rosie.
As do I.
What's the larger experiment?
Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.
You do?
You really enjoy my company?
You do?
I'm sorry about my parents.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Your entire body?
Do you like my new look?
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
I guess.
Thank you very much for that.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Shit.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Yes.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Lila...
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
Check!
Right.
It's open...  What'll you have?
Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
How?
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
I don't know when it was.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
Where?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
'Bout even.
It's a long walk.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Get with what?
I asked around.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Oh yeah? Where?
Aw, Eddie.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Glad to meet you.
What time?
By all means.
Okay?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Try me.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yes.
Eight o'clock.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
No, not always.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
What do you do on the other days?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
I could always get us a bottle.
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eggs. How do you like them?
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
He knows. A lot.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Is that what makes a winner?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
He went off someplace.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Yes.
Shhh... don't talk.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Let's check it out, Dad.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
What, Jim, what?
Better now, son?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
The back door was open.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Why, yes.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
David, don't...
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
I'll bet.
What's the bad news?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Just do it!
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
She didn't take my name when we were married.
David, you're drunk.
Great.
I can't shake her free.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
Be careful.
Yes, I am.
Really? Ballet?
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
I hear you.
Yes. My treat.
What is it?
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
I'm going after Dad.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
Tapestries?
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
An old man's dream.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Yes?
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
Pretty sure.
Uh-huh.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Rats?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Yeah?
Will you take it easy!
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Ships that pass in the night...
And do I detect a rebuke?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
I know, Dad!
It's a new experience for me.
The penitent man is humble...
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Why?
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Siam.
Their children?
A snake!
Just one arm!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Keep stroking it!
I know the feeling...
What does the writing say?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
Dr. Jones?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Quiet!
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
And they don't even know what it really is.
Figures...
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Why don't you?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Find You?
The man.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I'm at the airport.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
Eat it.
Without your pants.
Who, me?
That's a big if.
What glasses.
Are you serious?
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Don't get too cute.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
She's the toughest to read.
Not her. You!
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
I don't know!
Shit! You're in love.
Osaka.
On what?
Don't worry!
Where?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Gimme a minute.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Oh, I can't.
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
He work for us?
Bit expensive, sir.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
Do what?
When you remember...
Who...are you?
Oh.
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
Where?
What way?
Are you alright?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Your friends, did they ask about me?
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
Get us one.
What?
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Escape.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
We just don't stop.
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
It'l be alright.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Maybe later.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
You're sure you want to do this?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
"60 Minutes"?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Let me call you back...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Yeah.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Who are these people?
What?
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
Alright. What did you think?
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Did work.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
They should be.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
It's obvious, isn't it?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
You believe that?
No? No, what?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
Hello, can you hear me now?
She's okay.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Object to the form!
Object!
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
They hate each other --
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Uh... poetry recitation.
Mr. Massey?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Yes?
No.
Why do you think she did it?
Why would you be here?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
He wants a reconciliation.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
I have a surprise for you.
I want to nail you ass.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
What kind of "stuff?"
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
Meaning my house.
You do? You do love me?
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Please!
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Well what does he want?
I want to be exposed.
I guess.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Ah.
Nothing.
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
Miles -- why so angry?
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
Who said anything about a reward!
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for�
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day�whether it's coming to her or not.
Do you love her?
I might.
You talk as if he were a gigolo�or something.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
On the road.
Who is he?
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
I'm sorry you read it.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
What do they say?
No.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Yeah?
Maybe they do�and maybe they don't.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
You must have me confused with�
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
Shut up!
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Smart aleck!
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Egg. One egg�doughnuts�black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
King�King Westley was in it.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you�
You weren't so bad yourself.
How about Cinderella�or a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
No.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation�a warm heart�and a loving nature.
Oh, Peter� 
was so scared�that it scared�
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke�and hungry�and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this�  �with a follow through.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Darling!
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Me?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Come here, you little fool!
Do you know?
Left twenty minutes ago.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Get out!
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Listen, man�I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
I ain't got a hat.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is�"  No, do you really?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Why?
Five G's�or I crab the works.
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see�and�
Yeah. Just babies.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
You know you keep saying that.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced him as...
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
What about Ruby?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
I want the truth.
...you heard echoes.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
A Willie O'Keefe?
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Tough day.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
The assassination, Jack?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
And what would I have to do?
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
I can't believe you do me this way.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
And you didn't tell the Police?
She knows it's my case?
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Fine.
Shit.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Black's fine.
Yeah.
The Delfonics.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Fifteen thousand.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
What'd ya see?
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
You know some interesting people.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
I'm sure.
What's he doing?
Did you tell him you were leaving?
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
Not every day?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
What's her story?
Was she there?
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
So what happens now?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Dreaming.
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Are you getting that black suit?
Do you got something for me?
Thanks.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
And what was your answer?
I knew it.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Plus the same deal as before.
Uh-huh.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
Designer clothes.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Four days ago.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
Detroit.
You lived in Japan, when?
Who's arm is that?
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
And your point is?
Then what?
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Which one is for the car?
What do I do?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
What does that mean?
Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
You shot her twice?
Where did you shoot her?
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
What?
Tell me.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Where would you like me to put my ash?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
What?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
Uh-huh.
All I did was walk out with it.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
She's all alone.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
Turn left.
'Ola!
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
What isn't happening?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No, thanks.
I see.
Like Della.
Short? It's ended.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Well, try, huh.
There's nothing to expose.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Don't bother to call again, okay?
It's cold.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
I can't relax.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
No.  I see them.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Jacob Singer.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
I don't want to know.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Thanks.
Don't ask.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Why do you bring her up?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
That's your decision.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
I can do anything I want.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
You can have anything you want.
West.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
One drop?
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
Well that's good to know.
I would have stayed there if I could.
I no from around here.
I'm awake?
That's a lie. My family was here.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
You in trouble?
Yeah.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
I don't know what to do.
Pour it in.
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
Oh, come on!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
What?!
He came for me, I had to run!
What are you doing back?!!
Suit up.
I am an expert!
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
My job.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
Give me a break! What happened?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Eat me.
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
He's right behind us!
You lost the charge?
Just get us to the ship!
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
You killed him?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Am I in there?
No! He's coming with us!
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
30? How long was I out?
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
It's okay.
I want him out of the ocean.
Here --  Take him home.
What?
And incidental damages, if any...
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
What do you mean 'We...?'
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
The bilge pumps. There --
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Feed the dogs.
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Rogue?
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
You could say that.
What? What?!
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
I can't imagine why.
Pretty stiff.
You're leaving?
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
I've got all these signs here...
Anti-Shark cage.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
I'm okay...
What do you see?
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Ever see one like this?
I'm not hungry, oddly.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I'm supposed to be running.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
I totally heard you did.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
What?
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
It does?
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Can we make out now?
Did you hear it's yours?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Oh, go fly a kite.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
You're something else.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
But you're old!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Really? Fingernails?
Sure.
Then what's going on?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
I am a suicide risk.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
I'm pregnant.
Touche.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Hot!
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...Thank you.
Karma.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Sure.
Carryin' a gun.
...That's not true.
What?
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
...Too bad.
This guy killed a mess of people.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
The party?
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Where's Adele?
She wasn't feeling so good.
Siesta.
Wasn't my fault...
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...That'd be my guess.
You're clean.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
What do you mean?
You think?
Yep.
Right.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
He looks like my uncle.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
Shut up.
Yeah.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Where you goin' tonight?
Na.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
At the block party?
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Bang up stuff.
No, Fidget, I...
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
What?
No.
You are being ripped open.
I didn't bleed.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Mine?
To come?
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
You are!  I don't like you.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
No, only the path she chose to travel.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Why not?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
You like to brag, don't you?
No problem.  We're in.
What scars?
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Of course.
That has nothing to do with it.
That's great.
It's important.
And this Jeremy--
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
I got it from the tournament directory.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Answer the question.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
He knows you're aware of that.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Sounds very violent.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
She died in a car accident.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
You.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
There's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  You made a difference.
Do we have a future?
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
Turold's son was to marry her.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
I will find her!
You will know, in good time.
He has come for Lyssa.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Where the spiral begins.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Yes.
Staying alive.
We must try to get horses.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
I cannot go with you, my friend.
You do?
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
How many did you lose?
Her name is Death.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
That is true.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
It is no trickery.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
How can you say it?
Whoever.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Now, try a running guy.
OK.
You were scared, weren't you?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Why?
Too heavy.
I never rent my gear.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Nothing, for the moment.
I don't know... Five minutes.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Fine...
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
...Yeah.
I don't accept that.
It's impossible.
No it's not.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
Thank you.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
Can it kill me?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
He's plastered.
Yes.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Most certainly.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Tomorrow.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
What Mr. Parker?
I do.
In a hospital.
Do you have a car, Steph?
How are you feeling?
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
This isn't right.
What do you want?
Coffee?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
What do you mean?
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Don't be silly?
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
Oh, and what did you do?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
What did they look like?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Go to hell.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
That's not what's important.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
His dead body with a bullet in it.
Yes.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
-- uh --
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Name?
Really?
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Thank you. I love you, too.
Power yoga?
Not yet.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
You're serious?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Are you sure?
What, like on va-kay?
So are you!
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
East coast people are different.
You go where?
Where?
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Then we smash 'em?
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
But I'm hideous!
And you... are you not also afraid?
Like some vile toadstool.
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
What do I do?
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Aye!  That too.
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
It bodes evil.
We'll find it.
Easily spoken...
There isn't much time!
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
That's it!
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Sunlight, you say?
Mean you to seek him out below?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
He'll not escape me.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
Sorry.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Stop complaining.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
He did run?
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Only what's right...
They told me you were dead.
You've freed me, Jack...
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Pinching me!
Everywhere!  Ow!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
What became of the princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Is she fair, this princess?
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Please...
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
You do know where it is?
We did a lot of the wiring too.
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Who are all these people?
I'll survive.
He seems lonely.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Is that legal?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
Where's your dad?
No.  That's okay.
Really?
I'm okay.
I don't want you to!
I'm not gay.
I thought I was helping you.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
It's thirty feet.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
He buys and sells the world.
I'm not.
Forty.
What can I do for you, George?
I didn't recognize you!
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Thank you.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
No.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
Did you got through my pants?
I might have a solution.
No.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Why wouldn't she leave?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
God, you look like crap, George.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
A blueprint spool.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
Going on?
That was the truth.
What did he say?
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
Should I?
What?
You can't go because of Sam?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
I never asked for more.
I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
This is what he wants.
Why?
What did you say?
Dad said it first.
Nagger?
He's a big one.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
But I'm having a good time...
That's because I've never been here before.
I know it begins with a "C"...
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
My daddy gave me this watch.
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
What do you want, Claude?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Does that mean I'm in?
What'd you say?
I said you're soft.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
You get ketchup?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Him?
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
No problem. Oh, boy!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
You heard what the man said! Move it!
1932? That's like, that's like...
Rayford!
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
Anybody else need anything read?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
They run but they never get too far.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
You mother...
Sure, why not?
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Release the evil?
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Everything's fine, pop.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Coulda been much worse.
Boogerland!
You're not saying it's up to me?
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
We know where to find Nicky.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
My dad's an optometrist.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Sometimes, sure.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
No.
Yeah. The deep South.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
All right -- what are you?
From? From? From?
That's better.  How do you want us?
Up there.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
I'm fine...  See you...
I'm Mary 2.
When do you go up?
Please... No.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
He was killed.
No.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
It's different now. Help me.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
I have.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
And yours.
Of course.
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Is it inside the city?
I don't know.
All this. All of it.
What people?
I don't know... but it does.
At least it's over...
Where are you going?
I have always been here...
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
Can you make it back?
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
What do you mean by that?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Or not so recently?
Yeah... Laurent.
It's me...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
In pornos?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Sure.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
What happened to me?
The wife killer?
No.
You talk to him?
Who is it?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Who's it from?
Does it say anything on the tape?
Maybe.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
No... of course not.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
I can see that.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
No. No, I don't.
What night?
I was?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Yes, sir.
A what?
A paleontologist.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Good morning�
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people�
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
That's intelligent.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Centuries.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
Yes, charming.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"�  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Now, what would you like to do?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago�  �you're still alive, Father Perrault!
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Yes.
Come on! Quick! This way.
Yes, Bob.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Oh, George . . .
She's going with me.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
What do you suggest?
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
That was easy. I read your books.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
You see, it's not a dream.
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
The hell were you thinking?
Cowan--
Cowan--
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Actually, it didn't come from me.
You do?
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
I think that's what's happening...
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
What if he's telling the truth?
Right.  Oh, and here.
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
How could it not?
Come on now.  People are smart.
It's... coming.
They're not my pals--
What if I don't?
The what?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Did it leave?
Oh shit!
Don't tell me.  Insects.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Is it now?
What?
What is it?
RUN!
Yeah --
We know each other?
How do I find the --
Drowning.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Everybody runs.
Did Marks close the front door?!
Uh-huh.  Jad?
We're in motion on something.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
You gonna tell on me?
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Then take her to Radio Shack.
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
Who said I would?
What the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna kill me...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
Why?
If... you have one.
Then how did he --
Sean --
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Lamar --
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
I'll be right there.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
They're everywhere.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
How many?
I forgot my glasses.
Yes.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
Yes.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
What does he want with a precog?
Snifter are for warm drinks --
So?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
We're in Fashion.
He's alright.
Come on. Let's go.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
What'd you say?
I don't get it.
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah. Where is he?
What's his name?
What's that?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
Why?
Pshhh...
They were out of line --
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
I don't understand.
I know.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Yeah.
What is it?
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Can you check?
So, it was a draw.
I will.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Pretty nice.
Nah, don't bother --
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Yeah. What vibe?
About what?
Fuck this.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
He wants to see us now.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
I'm pretty sure we do.
Eighty five.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Drinks are free, right?
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
No?
Come, now. You just got here.
Yeah.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Lemme write it down for you.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
What you say?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
A black man playing big league ball is something.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
Because you're in trouble.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Shhh!
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
You put it very well.
I say a lot of things.
With him?
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
Eat lead, coppers.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
What can you do?
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Are you sure?
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
No. It would be convenient, but no.
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
So what do I get in return?
Where does he live?
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
Yes or no?
Why not?
I'm looking for potential.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
That's right.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Where?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Yes.
Did you used to?
You were never late before, I was worried.
Could I stop you?
That's not a question.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
For an American she understands this country very well.
Don't forget your towel.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
I think it's fantastic.
What? Who?
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Two tourists who never went home.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
What makes you say that?
I could see she likes you.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
What for?
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Are you kidding?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
We just talked.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
She wasn't so bad.
I don't think I remember him.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
Yes, I know.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
All right.
How do you do?
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Marty...
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Waddaya talking about?!!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
Or her figger.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Duke Forrest.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Call Dago Red.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Yeah, if I can.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
They're coming.
He can move in here with us.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
I think we could still have a chance.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
But I'm married.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Why would he do that?
Second pint.
Yes, Reverend?
There's only one worth noticing.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Homosexuality.
Just in dreams?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Sir?
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
Arterial silk.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Anybody! Er, er�Beany'll do!
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that�eating a sandwich�and with a beard!
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Awwwww!
That's�
Where's Connell?
I used to pitch.
What?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
All right. You're walking along�not a nickel in your jeans�free as the wind�nobody bothers you�hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business�shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you�it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
The elevators are still runnin'.
Sure.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and�
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people�
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
Did you want to see her about something important?
That's too bad.
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove�flopped into a chair�and has taken out his ocarina.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
No shit! He's good!
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
I'll take half of your action.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Sorry... Habit.
I've rarely shot anyone.
You don't like New York?
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
To run last?
Is it always like this?
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Stay put.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Yeah.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
SHIT!
Any verification on numbers.
Come on!
True.
It's all been transferred.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Just like you always wanted.
In a computer program.
It's not real.
Not real?
I'm South Dakota.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
You've got the keys, send someone in --
No.
Yes.
For what?
Realize?
I know.
Access established.
Uplink selected.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
It will not harm you.
Stylin'!
... Let's take a look over there.
... We must try to communicate with them.
Release the power with the power.
A stellar idea, Skull.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Did I say anything?
Quack like a'duck!
GO IVAN!!
Strength in numbers!!
LET'S DO IT!?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Tell me about it.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
What do you mean?
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
He's got a line on the good stuff.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
I'm already late.
It's too late.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
How soon can we pull this off?
Who?
What's your problem?
Ben-jamin.
Never threaten me, Boss.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
You gotta plan these things.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Not a lot ta know.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
I'll take care of the Boss.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Luciano is dead?
I didn't say anything.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Well - you'd need a body.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that pi�ata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
<i></i> In what way?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
I might wake up.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
You know, you never tell me anything.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Aaron?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Mm hmm.
What happened?
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Blow a bugle!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Drunks are funny--
Yeah.
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Again? Good idea.
Okay. You don't mind?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
What?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Why me?
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Now, pet--  Jim!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
How do you feel, champ?
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
*But you never asked me*!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Is *what* getting me down?
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Certainly. Step right in.
Uh--could--could I help--?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
No.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
I have no defense against forged papers and--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Fine--
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Most natural thing in the world!
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
No! Stop it!
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be--
Already? All these letters?
Not another bill?
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
Ring the call to quorum.
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
Well--I can *manage*--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
That's right.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Nice *compliment*!
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
You won't stand for it?
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
You can't say *that* to--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Senator Paine.
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Who's that?
Any children?
Yes!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain�
What's that got to do with it?
What happened?
Why don't you try?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Yeah, I know.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Shhh!
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
You're going to New York with us.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
No, thanks.
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Nah.
I've got one for Cobb�
What're you talking about?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Me?!
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Oh. That.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet�  �thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Farmer?
Where is your farm?
Oh, I do too, sir.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
One hundred books?
What happened?
Doubtful. What did he say?
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
A friend?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
How do you mean?
What's that?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Althea hasn't told you?
I do.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
What?
Yeah.
Well, come on in.
My patient had to leave early.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Why do you watch?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Did you straighten her out?
I think you do.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
It's all right.
And this is legitimate therapy?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I don't know if --
I don't follow you.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
Will you wait for me?
It's a big part of the show.
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
It matters to me.
What about everything? How did this happen?
No... no training.
I'm honored.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
You always did have more balls than brains.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
I am an English woman.
Forty.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
I found sand. I saw death.
If you call that a kiss.
I know my treasure.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
How?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
I think you were jealous
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Still...
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
Got it.
It must have slipped my mind.
I'm his daughter.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
I dunno.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
You're dead.
What have they got that we ain't got?
Bye. 
When are you going to take off that mask?
My heart died a long time ago.
We had an off night, that's all.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Not a chance!
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Well they've crawled back out.
I always knew that you were special.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
I'm glad you like it.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know, sire.
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Let me see it.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Ajaccio.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
What is that?
I see.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, I am, sir.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Were they pretty?
Yes.
Promise me.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
All right -- I promise.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
Can you give me a drink, please?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Very well, Citizen Lieutenant.  You have come to the right place, for I am Citizen Varlac.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Thanks, Unc.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Okay, plan B.
You already in.
No.
Me too.
Wait for what?
Better sooner than later.
It's locked.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
I don't play for no team.
I do.
Yeah, pops!
Smokin' what?
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
Let it go!
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
20 minutes?
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
Sorry, my ass.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
What?
Take your car.
'Take your car?'
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
I threw my back, again.
Aw, too bad.
Ah.
You were very nervous.
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
Who did?
What?
What's your point?
Tell me why I miss him.
Let me talk to her again.
Don't you threaten me.
No, that's,..that's fine
Okay...
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
How did you see us kiss?
Right.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
I know you do, honey.
All right. Kisses to you.
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Yeah.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Fuck you!
What?
Help me get her off the rug.
Keep your eyes peeled.
What about them?
Go ahead, sugar Die.
No.
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
You, Preacher?
Yes, Dad.
Not even her?
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Mother, I only --
All to pieces!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Ah.
What!
Blue men.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
She's gone to Moundsville.
Hush.
I'll make coffee.
Huh?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Yes. Yes.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
What?
You could save him, little bird.
What's your name?
Where's the money hid.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
Where's she at?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
This man down at the Drugstore...
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
John and Pearl!
What?
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
You believe in anything?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Used to. Not anymore.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
You know he's dead though, right?
Nan, I --
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
How you know that?
Get into bed.
So he's alive?
You were screaming like crazy.
Have you any money?
Aren't you late?
Well, a hat...
Evening gown?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
What is it, Anna?
I don't want to go to Siberia.
...des raisins de Mad�re, des framboises... 
Right now it's on the balcony.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
No, no.
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
Shall we tell her?
We have opened a restaurant...
The Duchess...
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Go to bed.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
But you can't...
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
I'll send you a muff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Kopalski...
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
We did our best, Comrade.
What can I do about it?
Don't hold that against me... please!
Private.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
How long do we have to wait here?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
That's a strange angle.
So that is your house?
Please don't misunderstand me...
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Thank you. Thank you.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
That is correct.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
You repeat yourself.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
I don't think so.
Yes.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
No. Nobody will find us.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Much happier.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
You haven't seen her yet?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Yes, Swana, you did.
No... please...
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
What?
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Go on.
May I have your bags, madame?
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
Yes... leaving immediately.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
You did say it, sir.
Son of a bitch.
Uh huh ...
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Yes ... I got the money.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
How so?
Yeah?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
And?
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
So?
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
Their fourth!
What's Liddy got?
Yes, you approved it, sir.
We were working on China.
Silence!
"Security" is not strong enough.
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
All right.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
You never told him?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Why me?
Is it my turn?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Yes.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
Winning?
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Her name's Sandy ...
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
I beg your pardon --
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
I was the lesser of two evils.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Mr. Nixon.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
I've missed you.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
You're a long way from Whittier.
When?
Hiding what?
Thank you.
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
You're drunk!
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
No.
The old boy shot by the highway?
Sheriff?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
I always am.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Yes. Things fall into place.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Goin' out.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Llewelyn --
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Promise?
She'll be all right?
I know where the money is.
And where is that.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Yessir.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
You said that.
You live in that house behind the store?
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
They'll give you a wallop.
You on all night?
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Yessir. I understand that.
That's not an answer.
What do you want to know?
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
What did I say?
Don't jack with me.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
No, I didn't have to.
What about it?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
...I... I know what you are.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I'd rather not...
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
What?
What are you talking about?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
You told me that two hours ago.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Yes... maybe it was.
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
...well, then you ain't got much.
I came for love...
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
It was Chloe...
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Dr. David Ravell.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
The one you were telling me about?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
Fine.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
He is real.
Rosa...
I have to leave now.
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Really. And where was that, old man?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That is so right.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
...that's a good motto.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
What?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
You made your point...  I was wrong.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
He's waiting...
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
"A Reason to Love."
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Fire! I hate fire!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Well, we need that ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
That don't make no sense!
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
It was a powerful air.
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Nobody. It just came to me.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Yes, Joe.
No, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Yes, sir!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir.
No, sir!
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Everything was different.
You hope.
I haven't made up my mind.
What do you mean?
No way... Would you?
I do.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Yeah? Why're you here?
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
That's it?
God.
No, they're for your mom.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
What would you do differently?
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
So?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Why?
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
Shhhh...
Sure.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
But she expects you to marry her?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
It's mine.
I have the gun.
Please...
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
Get the fuck away from me.
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
You're an idiot.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Shut up and let me think.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
I did.
Shit!
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Adios.
No ball, kid.
Master closet.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
Open it.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Well, I know that now.
The crowd goes wild.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Fuck.
To prove he wasn't chicken.
Come on, come on...
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Blue is phones?
On it!
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He --
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Yeah... whatever you say.
Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Who's they?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Are you finished?
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
We're working on that...
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
So talk...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
I don't know.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
I don't know about that.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Ain't no one seen him.
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You believe that?
Good.
It's a start.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
As do you.
Apology accepted.
Oh?
I consider them linked.
How can we end this madness?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Oh?
He tried.  It didn't take.
How old are you?
Flanking riders?
Pride is his weakness.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Granted.  Where are you going?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Gabriel.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Not held, just slowed down.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
It is ended.
But what about Thomas?
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.
And what is the second thing?
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Ayuh.
Well...I guess not.
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Yaay!
Yayyy!
Well, I thought it was safe--
For a little while.
Yes.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Allman Brothers.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
I don't know.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
You'll see before long. Let's go.
You keep saying that.
This time I mean it.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
You don't understand--
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Louis, are you sure?
No you won't.
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
Aye, for us there is.
Did you, now?
You're speaking up for him again?
Ceremony?
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
We're catching up!
We're not going to just surrender!
This must be some important boat.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
'Bootstrap?'
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Barbossa.
It's the right way.
You've seen it?
Yes, I have.
... no.
Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
And no lies!
You got it, Dr. Argon.
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
Opportunity?
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Who isn't?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
It already is.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
What happened to it?
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
The waste.
That's right.
No, no, I just feel wired!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Do you have something to bring me down?
What did you want my hair for?
Like a glove.
Where is it?
Argon's private lab.
Oh yeah?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Dexter.
Yes - isn't it.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Certainly. Right over there.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance�
For what?
For the letters, of course.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Now let's get this settled�
I know that.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters�
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
Are you crazy?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
You can't walk out of here like this.
You're acting like a child.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know�
Is that so?
Huh?
Is that so?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Yeah?
With me you can always do business.
Yeah, little Gloria.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Do you call yourself a reporter?
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Not on my own beat, no.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
My play.
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see�'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha�
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
�and that�
I didn't run away.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
Must be my wife.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
To Old Madrid.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Very good.
What did he want?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Okay - you remember Joe�
Have you seen this? 
I beg your pardon?
The name is Smythe.
Me, sir?
Found no skeletons?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
What?
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
Looks just like it did.
Bud?
I don't know.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
All night?
No I'm not sweetie.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
You want to get out of here?
... Lover's Lane.
So.
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Rain.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
It's not in ME.
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
What color is that hedge of yours?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
Jen please ...
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
It's okay.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
What?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
McIntire's.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Why?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Yeah ...
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
Why?
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Yeah.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah. 
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
You're so scared.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
It doesn't matter.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
You sound very cute, very nice.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
-- you said you did.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
I don't know.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
It's terrible, no.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Sure.
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Did you pick it up from the street?
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes no not really.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Yeah.
For what?
It's ok to ask that.
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Sorry.
And your name?
And your Social Security number.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
It's ok, take your time.
You want her to call you Jack?
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
Yeah.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
You should go on a trip.
WHICH?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Yeah.
I need to talk to you for a second.
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
What do you have in the house?
No.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Don't puss out.
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Bye, Barry.
No.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
Don't be so sure.
Enough to discern its tenor.
And --?
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
-- water! --
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
NEVER!
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
His wife's influence.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
That's not our intent --
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
Poorly.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
I don't believe it!
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Go on, child.
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
I pray you: be succinct.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Uh-huh
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Yeah
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w...  will.
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
You needn't use that language with me
I just want to understand--
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Like a bug.
But with compassion and insight--
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Please don't say this.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Fuck you--
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
How?
She was . . . innocent
Craig is one syllable
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
No, you gotta hear this-
What does this have to do with--?
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
To do what?
Yes
CITIZEN KANE
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
We done?
It's not done.
You know?
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Yeah, she's nice.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
You want the title shot?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
What do you mean, "you"?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
But, Jake, I was just...
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
What did I do?
I am answering...
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
You did?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
I dunno.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Never felt better.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Right, the gym.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Not yet.
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Ever get an answer?
All the things I hate.
That depends on who "they" were.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Like an old hambone?
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Wrong day?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
I'll send you some comic books.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Yeah.
Did you get my note?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
I was.
Depends one which one.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Police?
Got a shovel?
Smart? She'll be arrested!
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Make the one you want.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
So do I.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Staying the night here, uninvited.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Nobody chickened.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Good luck, Buzz.
Jim Stark.
I like you, you know?
You see any cops?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
No.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
You what?
Will you wait a minute?
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
Sure.  Sure.
Just relax, please relax!
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Where did you get the gun?
You scared?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
We know.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Get away from me!
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
So then you moved?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Bully for you.
"Life is crushing in on me."
See, I'm new.
Oh.
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I felt like it.
I don't know.
Why?
I never felt so clean before.
Okay.
It's all right.
He hates me.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
I'll never get close to anybody.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Why?
Gabriel, let him go --
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
YES!!!
...whoever she is.
To all those cons...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
We sell children's toys --
Thank you.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Nick...
Your brother...
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You told him about Nick's letters.
Not without you.
We? What "we"...
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
Merry Christmas.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
But I never said Rudy.
I never told you my name.
I never worked at no casino.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
What'd they call her in high school?
And I worked there. For a year.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
Sing it in pictures, Nick.
No.
No way.
How'd you know my name...
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
What... Powwow...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
We're aware of your position.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
How do we do that?
Hell you haven't.
What?
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
And some pecan pie.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Mr. Brown?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
What for?
No, they're not.
You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
He don't believe in it.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Joe.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Let's go in the other room...
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
If we don't, he'll die.
You can't leave us here.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
But the rest is right.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
To the other side of the street.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
How's that?
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
Yes.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Lednov.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Finished, son?
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
You'll live.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
Well, say it.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
There's still tomorrow morning.
Who brought you here?
Because there's a man I want to see.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Sure.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Oh, sure.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
If you need me, I'll be --
Do I know you?
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
I meant you're into ghosts.
Yeah.
Okay.
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
Great!!!
Huh?
No. Try a little higher.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
It's okay.
Both of them?
We have to destroy him.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Don't touch me!!
Are these all the subjects?
What's this?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Professor!
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
What is it, Dwight?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Yours, or the turkeys?
Then let us prepare.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
You don't think...
Jeeezzz!
I certainly did not.
Is there a killer loose?
This is so silly. 
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
Don't I get a kiss?
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
Marvin A. Pickles.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
There is one big problem though.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
You forgot something...
Yeah �- sure.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
No.
Yes.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
I can't understand it at all.
But I like teaching school.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Well, that's illuminating.
Not from me.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
And you believe that?
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -� it fits in with what I saw -� she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
It's here, too.
Cloven hoof?
I'd hardly describe It that way �- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
But you would like to know where she is?
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -�will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
I'm afraid not.
Thank you, my dear.
Why?
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
Yes?
Television?
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
I feel like they do.
Kids? What about them?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
You had sex with you therapist?
No.
Why not?
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Yes.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
No.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Don't you get lonely?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
Possibly.
I'm not either!!
Always the lawyer.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
Not very often.
No, I didn't.
What upsets you about that?
No, I haven't.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
No, I didn't.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Why did you do that?
But why did you want to?
Why?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
That's all.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Your first sexual experience.
Very much live.
Different.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I did.
When?
What's so stupid about it?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
Right.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
It won't. I trust him.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
She held up very well.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
No.
He said immediately.
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Sure.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
Did I say anything?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
No? How come?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
I got it!  I got it!!!
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
You too, Betty!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
That doesn't make sense.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
I NEED SOME
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
No...couldn't I do this later?
F for...
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
We love you, Baby.
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
Huh.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Bottle.
You got it.
Is it chicken?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Not so bad yourself.
Maybe. Recognize this?
That's a good age.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
When do we get to drink it?
Want some?
You know that chick?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Fuck you.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yeah.
Been checking your messages?
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Shut up.
What's happening?
Huh.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
You're so negative.
What the fuck!
Oh yeah? How is it?
Twelve months in oak.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Yeah. Thanks.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
Got it.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
I'm pregnant.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Both.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
It tastes old.
This one?
No dad!
Don't touch him.
I see.
Curse and stuff.
Just make noises then.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Don't.
They tell you everything in this book.
Who wrote this book?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Six months.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Why not?
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
You're in here for winging a guy?
What friend is that?
The one with the shotgun.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
That's it.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
Not for five years.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
It's a town...
Anybody got any ideas?
What happened?
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
The other guy drew first.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
We'd rather stay.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Why come to me?
Where's the dog?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
I thought we talked about that.
What's she got to do with it?
Paden.
So-called?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
I'm ready for that.
I don't want you to get hurt.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Spare me.
The picture's dead.
Why not?
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
You really think so?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
You're with me to be close to her?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
Why not?
How did the wall get there?
Somebody said she was here.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
I'm sorry.
Not like this --
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
There was no other way.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
She did... didn't she?
I could get the death penalty.
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
Dark?
Yes, very.
Long live the First Amendment.
Thank you.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I am the death of real.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
No.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes, I am.
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Really?
Don't get mad.
They?
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
Cole, please stop.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
Chuck E. who?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Superstition.
Alright!
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Tramp.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Sorry.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
I could. You sucked.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
This is his room... isn't it?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
The audience!
Down boy.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
He started it.
He's right. You were behind.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
About what?
Wait a minute --
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
And that makes you look like a squid?
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Okay.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
I got to leave my post.
Do it.
What can I do you for?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
It's just a work thing.
Grant, you're sick!
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Having fun.
Would I lie to you?
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
We lost him.
Yeah.
Hey...
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
See.
Bandit?
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Clear and rolling.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
What's that, pardner?
Yeah, but...
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
What kind of personnel?
No.
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Pretty much, yep.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, why.
That's not possible. I told you.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
I said I got his machine.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
I am. Yeah.
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
...He does now...
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Got hit twice.
Like a mafucka.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone.  Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
I can trust Rheya.
Why would you let her to do that?
How?
And professionally?
My wife.
Probably.
Told you what?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Human beings can die.
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Get out --
Just get him to stop.
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Yes.
Let's go home.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
What do you mean?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
What kind of look?
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Why did she do it?
Those are dreams.
Gibarian.  He was here.
It's all right.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
I want you here.
But then I would be dead now.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
Please.  Don't.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
There's a phone in the car.
I got money.
So it was "love".
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
I know.
Mike...?
Listen, I'll... see you again.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Claire...
Get in bed.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
What shit, honey?
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
What did you watch?
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
I just sat and listened.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
What about when she identifies him?!
No, I need'm now!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What the fuck you doin'?!
We're gonna pass the street.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
I don't think she can sing, either.
You stop him?
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
I know.  I've got one too.
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Would you cool it already?
Fine.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
It's too early to be clever.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
You should write that one down.
What's your problem?
I've got no problems.
I think I'd like that.
Well, no.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Strong...
So you've found Thorkel?
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
We did not.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
Forget it.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Sefton!
What are the chances busting out of here?
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
It is.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Stop it, Harry!
No. Your eyeball goes. The top of your head. Gotta wind up with athlete's stomach.
Where'd that come from?
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
It's not good for you, Animal.
Why, sure!
You have a Lieutenant here...
Yes, sir.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Says who?
Who did?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Here. Take them.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Yes, you do!
How many do you want? A thousand?
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
What do you mean?
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
And destroy every planet in the system.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
Really? What do you feel?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
It's our pleasure.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
No, I didn't know that.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Aye, sir.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
I have already made one transmission too many...
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
... How long?
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
What's wrong?
What? What are you saying?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Why would you do this...?
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Welcome home, Jim.
May I ask why...?
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Report status!
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Then, how --
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
Station!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
That's all you have to say?
I'm not a drama critic.
Say thank you.
From yourself, Admiral.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
... taking Genesis away from us...
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Who --
Mother, go back!
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Inoperative.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Aye, sir --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Not at present.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Aye...
Home.
I would not presume to debate you.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
They just don't want us going in there.
Understood, sir.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Aye, Captain.
By the book...
Why don't I?
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Understood. What is your plan?
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
Just lucky, I guess.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Noon tomorrow...?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
... Damn!
Permission granted.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Surely you can be more specific...
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
I cannot tell a lie.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
On screen!
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Mercy Hospital.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
On screen.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Two?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
On my way...!
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Millions?
If you'll follow me, Professor --
The keyboard... How quaint.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
This way!
I don't.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
Really.
Sometimes I do.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
No, I mean...
Why not...?
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
No.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
Good luck. Dougherty out.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
Scan for lifesigns.
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
We're through running from these bastards.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
We're not going anywhere.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Beam him out!
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Gorch?
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
Yes...
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
More lies.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
What?
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Where?
I have the password right here.
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Jean-Luc Picard.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
California. San Francisco.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
No. It's a lot further than that.
Steady as she goes.
No, sir.
We've lost Bridge control!
Riker here.
Commander... we have a problem.
Target...
You may need assistance, doctor...
That's the question -
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Retire.
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
You feign ignorance?
Yes.
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Who else?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
They're dying.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
WE SURRENDER.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Not as yet, sir.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
An omission. After that -
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
What exactly does that mean?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the �Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the �Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat�
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
I do not understand.
I know.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Now, you make a toast.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Of you?
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Of course, sit down.
And I you.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
Aye, sir.

I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Your new chair, sir.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
You know I do.
What happened?
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Yes.
I know.
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
I came this far alone ...
Praetor.
Now go. I have some personal business.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
Probably kids.
No, we can handle this.
It's taken on a disguise.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
Good.
Smile.
Yes.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
The driver will...
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What is hell?
Why?
That was beautiful.
Come on.
I feel better if I move.
No.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I must go.
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
Yes.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
No, Lenny.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
No.  Mace is in this.
You think Tran killed her?
That's right.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
What?  Right Here?
That's not sayin' much.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
Why me?
Is he dead?
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Who was just here?
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Commissioner Strickland.
Your sex life?
Sleaze to peddle.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
So that gives you something.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Yeah, right.  Fucked.
Aw, Mom!
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
Testa?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Anybody talk to the press?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
I'm on my way.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
What?
She's buried.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
What do you want from me?
Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
Smarter than us.
Who?
Then why do I still have a badge?
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
I'm hesitant to...
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Five months. I love it.
Not especially.
It explains a lot.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Huh?
Oh yeah, I forgot.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
I've been thinking about this.
We did find these, however.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
I just need to go a little slow.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
How are we going to find him?
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
Speck is dead.
Take your shirt off.
No. Stop, come on.
Shut up.
What kind of car do you drive?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Yes. Like the quiche.
How?
What what? What advantages?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Sorry?
You have to lay it on the table.
Oh... right.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
I can call back...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...
So I don't call either way.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Thanks. Thanks, man.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
I'll give you an eight. 
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Well, let's hit that party.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
You always know the right thing to say.
Make someone bleed.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
That's right.
I don't know...
When?
Wait.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
...Baby...
Baby, we're money.
Yes!
I gotta use the phone.
Sorry about interrupting...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Selling scrap metal.
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
...It looked money.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
Oh. He's got it under control...
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...How novel.
See, baby?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
Six.
And what is that Bonasera?
I ask for Justice.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Shut up.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
Barzini.
And now, what do you choose to do?
What else do you believe in?
Where are you going?
Corleone.
Yes.
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
We should hear what they have to say.
And when they shot me father...
Can you do it Mike?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Did he give you his politicians?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
You know I love spaghetti.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
What time do they expect us?
Michael.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
Tell me you love me.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Cut it out.
Probably a year...
I do wish to be baptized.
Be patient.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Shut up!
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Oh, it was.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
He's downstairs.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Marge and I are getting married.
What evening?
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
I just don't believe that!
Such as?
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Okay.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
He's not a man, he's a god.
It's superb.
What about Cortina?
Ha. Did he say why?
I think you're right.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
You were going to Venice.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
I don't believe you.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
Right.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
I'll fix some drinks.
Do you want me to stick around?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Was that Meredith?
Why lie?
Peter, I... I...
You're such a liar...
Postmortem?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Even your fianc�e...?
A few days ago.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Nah. I ain't interested.
Where do you live?
I know. I could have picked you up.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Sure.
Oh, Tom, please.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Just what?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
What taxi driver?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
What did you do?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
You carry a piece? You need one?
You looking for some action?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
You can do it in my mouth.
Don't you understand anything?
Don't you want to go?
Pittsburgh.
Why?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
There must be something...
I can't sleep nights.
I know. I tried that.
How's your driving record?
Physical? Criminal?
So I hear.
Why do you ask?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Oh?
Sure.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
Wait.  Where're you going?
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Whatever happens.
I wish you were coming with me.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
That always used to work.
Dad... 
You mean,  me?
I had it, a minute ago...
How'd they get it inside?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Yeah...
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
Exactly.  And he got good.
That's... pretty frightening.
Thanks.
I see...
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I do.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Shhhhhh.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
Did you... did you...
Jesus.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
I know.  A Purple Heart.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
I taught you that.
I can play the piano?
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
Yeah... me too.
Oh.
I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here.
You bet, honey.
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
Yes?
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Different?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
Oh, I suppose so.
I know.
The little Brenner girl.
Right across the bay there.
And the white house?
I see. How do I get down there?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
Well, you're the lawyer. 
They're back!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Cathy. At the school.
And if you don't?
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Did you close the door?
Not by the thousands.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
No, of course not.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
But how... how do you know my name?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
So you didn't go to school together.
But you tore it up.
Why?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
No, tell me.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Certainly, of birds.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
Take wing!
With my little sparrow leading team.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
What time is it?
Yes.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
I'm not sure, but...
I haven't finished my drink.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
But can't you give me any idea?
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
I can't believe that.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
The heart pumps it.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
I know --
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
Aye.
What? Call the police?
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
He didn't kill her.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
I mean Lauren.
It still doesn't mean...
You killed her!
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
That was my first question.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
No -- not at all.
I assure you such power exists.
That can easily be arranged.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Why not, Bobby?
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
What about him?
Is that what you're thinking about?
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
What time is it?
Where is the meeting going to be?
I'm sorry.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
You better get some fresh air.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
The meanest!
The baddest!
Yeah.
No.  Stick around.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
There's a cop behind us.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Good!
I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.
He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no, you won't.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
C'mere, Nanook.
No, I'm not...
Mom!
Lucy.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
I hear this is the decade for cute.
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
Well, I...
Star.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Okay.
No... no, everything's different now...
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Wanna go to the comic book store?
You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
Don't turn on the light.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
You promise?
But...
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
What clothes?
We ain't buying that.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
All in Norwegian.
Nothing we can do about that.
A day or so ago... I guess.
After all this mess.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Well, stick to it.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
Extinguishers.
I am going after them.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Damn if I won't.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  When a man bleeds it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
Everything that's been missing.
Calm down and get in your position.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
What?!
What else can they do?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
What are you?
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
But you escaped.
Can you show us where they live?
Last night.
The air... the power.
No, we created the Morlocks.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Dance with me...
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Got here as soon as I could.
No... let's walk through the city.
Alex, it's just the zoo.
I have something for you...
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
Nothing.
Do you find her?
What is it?
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
Yes...
More than 800,000 years.
Why not?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Every night.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Thank you.
I can see Kalen's point.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
So you can use it now?
Go back to your own time?
Do you have it?!
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
It's not my job to believe you.
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
That's too bad.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Our car won't start.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
[Beat] What?
After I...
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Yes.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Why?
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
I'm doing fine.
How?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
Why would we do that?
I'll die either way.
The future doesn't look different?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
Good.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Is it true?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
That when you stopped being a nurse?
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Why?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
In the leg.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
That's certainly possible.
What for?
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
And what's the mysterious code word?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
In case of what?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
How come he let you go?
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Yes.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
It's probably not a good idea.
She thinks he's a pig.
I heard that.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Well, you got it now.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
About how fast was I going?
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Are you alright?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Oh.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
How do you stay so positive?
We're fine!  How are you?
Fresno.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
He implied it.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Loser? You?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
His mother?
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Yeah feels like it.
Got cash.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
Out getting coffee.
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
Mary.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Am I?
Thanks.
Pat Healy.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
A fucking moron.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Sure.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
Four kids, three different guys.
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Among others.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
I think a little of both.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Cuba.
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Back to work.
I was, you bastard.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
I don't care. Cancel it.
I don't know. I don't know.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Jesus Christ...
Rug samples.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
I see.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Good. Thank you.
Check him out, Ray.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Beats the hell outta me.
I gave it back to her.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Yes.
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
His spiritual mother...
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
He knows me?
He said he doesn't know.
And...
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
What'd you expect to hear?
Cuz you're a cop.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Who did?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
I desecrated it?
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Good.
-- your father was part Sioux.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Leavenworth a tough joint?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
How the hell do you know?
I could be, too.
How did you know this was my car?
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
You saw a MiG 21?
I was inverted.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
And far too aggressive.
The what?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.

I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
Why?
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
Where'd you get it.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
I sit. I think. I play games.
I was, later.
I hope you find him.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
Let's hope you're right!
He better be kidding!
What is?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
NO. NO GOOD.
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
Okay, okay.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
What do you want?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Why do they call you Wolf?
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Look, Ma, top of the world!
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
I can't eject.
Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. No mistakes. Wears you down. After enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
What'd you do?
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
That's because you don't have any women.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
Just below ten thousand.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Didn't everybody?
A good man. Good flyer.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
All right.
Or you can quit.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
I think my grampa might be here.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Identification?
Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Relax, you'll live longer.
No shit...
Quit while you're ahead.
I don't know.
Move to Mars.
All right, forget about it.
Lori, don't you understand?  I feel I was meant for something more than this.  I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
I'm here at Rekall.
Right.  Mars.
Hauser left me a note.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
I saw them.
The one in the mine!
Aliens?!
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
In a minute.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Do not talk to the driver.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
I'll go with that plan.
A man who plans ahead.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Right.
I'm gonna help you.
Only if something happens to me.
Yeah...but no ties.
What?
You okay?
Let's assume that it is.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
LET'S DO IT!
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Damn right I'm right.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool.  Next exit.
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
You're doing a murder case?
I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
...Okay...
How can I tell you what I don't know!
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
-- Every word.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Get lost Bobby.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
The stuff we got last night.
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Did she have someone with her?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
And neither will I.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Shorthand. Really?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
It's late, Sam.
I'll get my kit.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
You didn't do your homework?
The usual, 9:15.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
No, I want to smoke.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Dancing.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
WE got it back, that's all.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
But Bob isn't real.
What does Bob say?
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
Let's go all the way.
What?
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
Hiking?
They were looking for wood.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
What were you doing in my room?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
It's a school night... back by nine.
Fine.
...school's fine...
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
Stay away from me.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Who am I?
You're right. There's no one here.
Yes.
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
I wouldn't do it.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Well, many reasons, actually...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Well...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
Why is that?
'Code Blue'...
And you wrote that...
I'm sorry...?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
I used to be a nurse.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Listen to me, fella...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Overruled...
Exception!
The TV didn't work.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Laura.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
Missus...
Nothing happened.
Who are you protecting, then?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
It's a long road that has no turning.
...now who is that...?
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
I'm going to get laid.
Oh shit, what's today?
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Yeah. I'm awake.
What difference can that make...? All right...
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
She told me.
How'm I doing so far?
Huh.
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
What's he like?
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
Don't let's lose each other.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
What?
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Not sleepy.
Call it a guess...
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
Robert?  I...
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
He knows.
You sound so sure.
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences.  It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Whatever.
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
What about you?
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
You only hurt yourself you know?
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
I guess.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
No, I didn't.
I know you will.
I can't watch this.
I just brought you something to eat.
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
I couldn't.
Speak up boy!
It was my fault.  I slipped.
But you invited is aboard.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
I know.
Take good care of my son.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
A padlock.
They'll know about it in the morning.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
Trust me donut.  I know.
What?  Come on...
I figured it out.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
It hurts too much to care.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Then keep your mouth shut.
I'm not staying out here.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
I can't be sure.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
It wasn't hard.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
This be it?
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Ready for another?
Whattaya mean family?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
You hitched yet?
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Was in all the papers three years ago. I'm seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
But I'm wild at heart.
I'm sorry.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
This 'bout the fifth time?
What I made you do, mama?
You ain't actin', mama.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
And?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
What's that?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
We got through two states already.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Let's get outta here, honey.
Fan works.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
So where'd you say you was?
Uh-huh?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
SAILOR!!!!
Damn!
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
What if I told you not to?
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Santos... It isn't.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
You need to explain it.
Where?
No... But...
You really are one dumb asshole.
Well?...
Mm.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Shit.
Competence.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Such as.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
I peeked.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
Yes.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
No.
Outside Scranton.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Jealous? Of me?
The hell I am.
What would you call them then?
Ah, wear whatever you want.
Oh. Well. I...
Who does?
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
And? Are you going to tell him?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
James Leer.
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
And the jacket?
Over there. In the backseat of the...
I said it didn't sound like you.
And you're old.
I guess you have to go on faith.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
I don't know. It might be...
As a heart attack.
And?
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
The perpetrator.
I like the noise.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
No thanks.
Ah, come on.
Annette will see you.
When?
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
Sure.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Do you come here often?
Not yet.
Yeah.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
What?
Yes.
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Banished... yeah.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
They sound like finches.
Yes.
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
You seem a little hostile today.
What?
That's right.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
You think reflection is good.
I don't need someone else.
Have to talk about something.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Is that what you are angry about?
We have a few more minutes.
I don't.
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
What did you want to happen?
I don't know!
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
All right.
I'm only asking questions.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Yes.
Accept you?
How do you feel about that?
I feel... okay.
You must hate it.
Yeah, they could.
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
No you're not.
You think I have a problem?
Yeah.
What did you do to them?
What?
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
Their power. They seduce me.
I was always the one seduced.
Being here, with me.
Which brother did this?
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Not ever.
Us seeing each other.
I'm not scared.
I've got problems.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
You're such an asshole.
What's your fucking problem?
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
That must be it.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
No.
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Now what?
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Tell me later.
Hi, lady.
Who then?
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Yuh?
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
A little more so this time.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
What! After giving us such a run around...
Four or five days.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Does it please you to say such things?
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
That's why I asked you...
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
To do what?
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
To the shark.
We'll try again.
You men are all so dreadful!
Here I am.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And what did they say about me?
Unfortunately, no.
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
I don't see why I should mind.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
No.
No.
He loves you the way you are.
It's a sin to be fat.
Of God.
Why?
Dear Jesus...
It made them holy.
Why?
They were stained.
What do you mean?
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
Yes.
No I don't.
Do you think he loves you?
Would you like to talk about it?
I don't know.
Something I ate.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Don't you know?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Would you like to be?
No.
I've stopped menstruating
You have trouble sleeping?
You'll laugh.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Not my fault.
That you're a mistake?
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
And why am I here?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
No.
Why?
Will she be angry?
A crucifix.
Are you ill?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Frightened.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Of course you do. Who was it?
I don't remember.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Why?
Thanks...
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
I'll have a decision by next week.
Who are you?
Marie's dead Mama.
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
I believe Agnes is different.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
I've already told you what I thought.
It's possible isn't it?
Who?
What?
Earthquakes?
Take at look at it.
Sister Paul?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Her spiritual health.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Saint Peter?
She's been touched by God, yes.
Who is he?
How  ?
You're saying God did it?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
I'm concerned about her health.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
For what?  An abortion?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
That's a lie.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
Eh?
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
The cards... you're bank.
Eight and two thirds.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Oh.
Sixpence.
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Yeah, grotesque.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Have I said something amiss?
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Follow your impulse.
I'll look in here again.
Come here.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
And what do you do about it?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
See you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Every morning.
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Oh, I see.
Don't be callous.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
What's old got to do with it?
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Ah, go on, you swine.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Oink! Oink!
You are.
Oh you do, look.
Oh yes.
Well ...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Who?
And they want me?
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
Hell, we're equipped --
Where the hell are we?
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
What's the terrain down there?
Don't you remember?
God I'm hungry.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
Dead!
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
Right.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
Boy, that's terrific.
It wouldn't come.
At least it can't get up here now.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
It's not going to work.
Is it armed?
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Maybe we could write it together.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
They're on the next level up.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Not a one.  It's dead.
What killed it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
Good.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Right now let's keep it closed.
... More spores coming.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
What can I do?
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
Yeah...
Is it dead?
I told you we... what's that?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Okay, give me the numbers.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
How?
Which mean physically going outside.
Sounds great.
How tight are these shafts?
What's the problem?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
How many... how many people are missing?
Well... try the headset.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
What time's sundown?
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
Eddie...
I believe I will.
Just like that.
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
It wasn't meant to be.
Frankly - yes.
Paved with what, then?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
We're?
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
You have no right to say such things!
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
You can have one at Max's.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
And too many of them are produced.
Margo.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Of course I knew.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
Huh?
Where's my coat?
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
I get a party, don't I?
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Who?
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
I wish it were.
A married lady.
I just wondered.
Why.
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
Your make-up's a little heavy.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
Oh, brother.
Now you want an argument.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
Don't be dense. The party.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
My husband...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
Oh, but there is-
I'm not crying.
But the raves about your performance-
Something most important you can do.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
Not at all...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Right here.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
The heave-ho.
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Well...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
You'll be there, won't you.
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
Don't joke about such things.
Where'd you get all that information?
I'm beginning to catch up.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
I'm glad Bill's back.
They'd die without each other.
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Up in the room.
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
I will.
Don't be evasive.
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
Miss Caswell?  What?
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
Hmm.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
What's the matter?
Morning or night?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
Well of course.
You can't.
I've got a lot of energy.
I know where Dwight works.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
--yes--
--there's nothing new in it--
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Howard Hunt here.
Where in government?
No.
I couldn't say.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
You can't believe that.
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
A girl. Melissa.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
...okay...
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Single malt?
Yep.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
That's nice.
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
I know, it sucks!
What?  We both have cars.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
No.
Do you?
Do you love her?
Then what the hell are you talking about?
I don't get it, that really works?
Pontificated.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
That's stupid.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
I'm not going.
You're not...busy?
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
She's a mermaid, dude.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
Tonight?
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Yes --
Yeah.
What?
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Bullshit.  From where?
Keep it down, dude.
Doing what?
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
I don't know... Surprise me.
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Andy!
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
A la votre.
Andy! No!
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
And you call me a moron...
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Not that I know.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Good day!
Who's Sophie?
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
I cursed then all!
Bartok... a question.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Pray he's color-blind...
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
And tell me that she's happy.
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
What's your name?
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
M'mm.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Why not?
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Do you feel all right?
Alvy.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
How can you possibly oversleep?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh - you're an actress.
Well, where is it? I-
Well... thank you again.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Yeah?
It's terrific.
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
Yeah?
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Those are the two categories...
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm not.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
It's for my complexion.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
I'm cool.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I'm late.
I thought just earplugs.
I did.
Commentary.
I can't.
What-
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
It's a narrow view.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Well, sit down.
M'hm.
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
I just have time to get the, uh-
I was a great beauty.
It has your ring.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
What?
I have a small window of time.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
Of course.
Oh.
Oh.
It's not going to come up.
Really?
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
I love her too, Joe.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Harry called.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Are you my big hard hero?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
Scout's honor.
Ryan's novel.
Ryan's novel?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
And how hard it hit?
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Yes.
I'll never forgive you.
I'll be with you.
He's my favorite.
Come on, Panes...
Don't I find what?
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm so sorry.
It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
They're nothing like us.
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Why?
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Are you working on a new book?
The charades.
Thank you.
Oh?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Do Peter Sellers again.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
It could be worse.
You see, that's worse.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Like the last time.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
We're just feeling our way back.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
I never like to talk about my work.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Wanna dance?
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Yes.
Quiet -- sshhh!!
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Stop fooling around in there.
You held onto this all that time?
Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
There's something going on, Z --
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
Affirmative.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
Shall we say -- a dollar?
It's a bet.
I sort of like it.
That makes me feel just terrible.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
Let me help you.
You don't want me here --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Who?
And where are you now?
I mean -- her apartment.
I'm not very good at it.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
Who'd care?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Over a girl?
Here.
I don't?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
That's very wise.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's very flattering.
You do?
Oh.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Swap them? For what?
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Sir?
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
You're going to take her off my hands?
Yeah --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Slow down, kid.
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Just as long as she's okay.
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Well, you can't win 'em all.
Not particularly.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Will you excuse me?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Important?
That's enough, Fran.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
I wasn't trying.
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
Don't you ever stop talking?
I told you -- with my mother.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Go where?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
We need all our fuel.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
No -- absolutely not --
One for all -- all for one --
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Call me what, sir?
Looks that way.
Who's he?
... he's an amazing officer.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Who knows what's up there?
Thta's not Charlie's work --
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Whose orders ?
Maybe.
Touchy.
No, sir.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
What about an American named Kurtz?
Your daughter.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot.
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
What?
Wh -- what?
What'd you do for supplies?
Hairy ?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
I met him.
What are you doing?
You had immense plans... immense plans...
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Then let's get the hell out of here.
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
His name is...
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
I should be checking on the boat.
Yes.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Well , who's in command here?
139  CONTINUED:
28   CONTINUED:
Oh.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
How did she..?
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
That makes the flight more interesting.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
What does this matter to you?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
It's a long shot.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
Me. My home number is on this card.
Will you please take it?
I've got Jews at my table.
Okay.
I see the help -- judgement call.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Just how grateful I am.
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Thank you.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What's that got to do with it?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Never.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
Cute.
Were you asleep?
Were you asleep?
What a break...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
You know what? I...
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Yes. I really would.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
No. No. Get Carol.
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Thanks for looking after him.
Think white and get serious.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Okay, then.
Get out.
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.
Thanks.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Got any easier questions?
Does it matter?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
But you know where you're lucky?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
Take us there.
Where are we going?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Someone hired both of you?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
He was killed.
Where you wanted to be?
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
Why not?
I was just different.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
The exotic women.
Because you are a women.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Why not?
Yes.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
Taiwan.
Transmits and receives.
Cheap as shit.
Okay.  Then what?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
What happened?
Was that it?
I didn't notice them.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Because, I'll take it.
Why?  I don't know.
Is this becoming complicated?
I'm not normal.
Right.
Electra --
Sometimes.
Sure.
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
Taken.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
American currency.
This will take some time.
No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
And not even then sometimes.
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
Squatted it.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Care to elaborate?
It's big, right Jahn?
And put it on expenses?
Tell them we're working for the University.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
Well, don't get carried away.
Tough break.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Who put a bee up your butt?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
Why don't we go together?
What?
She's cool.
What are you on about?
That bad?
So I hear.
You're kidding.
Did you see anything in the files?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
What do you want me to do?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
That's my mum's.
No!
They didn't look like medical files to me.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Ooh, well excuse me.
Let's have a look anyway.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
We don't need you.
And you broke into that room?
Fuck you!
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Yeah.
No problem, is it at your place?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Yes, if you can get him free.
We're not sure...
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
And what of these foreigners?
I. Don't. Dance.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
You sleeping with her?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
That'd be something.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
You do --
It was.
This play -- ?
And you have to meet my father.
That is my telescope.
Looking for something -- someone.
Yeah.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Yes. And?
And that would ruin your reputation how?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
What?
I have to get you home by one.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
What do you actually know with religion?
Away from here.
I'm sick.
I was going to fake it.
No.
I have expectations, too.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Ever again.
So talk to us about something.
Like what, sir?
Your parents are divorced?
In there.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
That's right. You just act like one.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
When do I get time for me?
Where did you get -- ?
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
Yeah.
What do you want, Biff?
Yes, sir!
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Uh, hi....
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Good.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Lemme see that.
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Not a holocaust --
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Nineteen fifty --
Yeah,  Right.
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
Oh yeah?
You don't mind?
They come with the house.
Okay.
Yeah.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Sure thing. Come on.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Nothing.
I don't care.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
He was nervous.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Git.
Beats me.
Who're you?
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
The door's locked.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
You look!  It's not here!
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Flying to Cambodia.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Bet I do.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
...Who?
Garland, it's me.
Just Bill, please.
Well... actually, no Bill...
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Who?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started�
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Well, you just... sound a little�
Can be. Not easy, but �
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game � door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies � though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
What do I write about?
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life � why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
See you, Charlie.
Why don't we go to your room-
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Yeah.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy � like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Yeah, but Charlie �
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Give you nose bleeds?
...Fred...
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
No.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
It's been three months.
No?
Who?
I thought you quit.
I don't need any help.
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
If that's the way you want to play it.
I quit.
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
No.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
My wife used to call me that.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
When?
Why?
Did you?  What's she doing?
Why?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Routine.
I hope I helped you out.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I wasn't there last night, either.
Why the hell not?
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
Yeah.  I know.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
And you volunteered.
It's yours.
He was shot.
I don't know.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
No.
You haven't been by lately.
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I'm here.
Decipher?
Yes, but as a black painter �
I'm not black.
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Should there be?
Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
Really?
Very well.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve � I mean Shenge.
What's wrong with you today?
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
I guess it was a long time ago.
Can I walk you home?
I think I could do that alone.
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
Basquiat, what did you take?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee �
Think so?
Pretty much the same.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Would you check out my studio some time?
Jean Michel Basquiat.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
So what?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
Forget it.
Yeah.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
That's ignorant.
I think I'll take the stairs.
We do.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I'm tempted.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
What're you doing three dates from now?
You first.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
All is shrill, all is blight...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Right here, sir.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Hey, what's your problem?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Can he save her?
She knows who we are.
From the other side of the equator-
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
But soon...
I wouldn't bet on that.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Like hell you do.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
You lie!
I find that unlikely.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Hardly a worry, sir.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Dr. Meridian...
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Master Wayne's dead wives.
And you are?
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
Exactly!
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
And now....
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
You do know. Try.
What?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
What the hell is going on here?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
... Very good, sir.
What are you talking about?
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
I loathe bats.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
... We could try that.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
What now?
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
What are you, scared of heights?
And what happens if we say no?
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
Yeeees?
And what did you say?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
David, I'm serious!
Meaning?
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Right first time.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
Thanks, Annie.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
You're not going to ....
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
Heh heh. Yeah.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
My butt's bothering me!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Heh heh, thanks.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Cut the power!
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Not now Bork.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
No, Jane.
Almost.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
What?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
... acts like she's thirty-five.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
Who did the sushi?
Just a hunch.
What?
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Oh puh-leeze!
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
You don't kill anyone.
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Life is just... too awful.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
No, dummy.  Two.
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
I'm lonely.
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
I'm sorry already.
I thought I saw something.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Attic space.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Their wedding clothes.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Yes, I suppose that's true.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
I wish he were here...
A Black man gave me the message.
Yes.
No. I like this attic very much.
My name is Chance.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Yes.
Our greenhouse.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Really? Really!!!
... I see.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Bravo!
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
I understand.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
Oh. Thank you.
I never needed money.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Good day, Sally.
I see.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Yes, I understand.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
... Hello.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Clearly, yes comrade.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Yes, I did.
... Well?
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Well, Ben... I...
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Malkovich!
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
The iguana.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
You bastard.
I'm a puppeteer.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
A better friend.
People make mistakes.
Sure, after a fashion.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
My tits?
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
A scary dream?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
The Great Mantini?
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Oh, be still my heart.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No.
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
When?
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Aw, Baby.
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You on your way home?
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
You grown.
Yes ma'am.
Ya think?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
She likes this dress...
True.
Can't locate him.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
I don't know him that well.
Aw, no, Ella.
I run him off.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
No use thinking these things now.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
No, You looking good.
Yeah, okay.
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Fuck you.
ANTI-SEMITE!
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
We have the urn.
My rug.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Uh-huh.
He's handicapped, huh?
Far out.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
And was there anything of value in the car?
I'm unemployed.
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Yeah man.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Oh, no.
No it's fine, really, uh--
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
She most certainly was not!
Well--yeah, I guess--
Well...yeah--
Well yeah...I know that.
Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback.
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Hey man--
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
Just for making the hand-off?
Yeah.
Huh?
Agh--
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
What the fuck is going on there?
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Yeah?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
No Dude.
They shot Donny!
Then what's...
Call the medics, Dude.
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
You're a fuck, Walter!
Who is this?
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Dude.
Bunny.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Am I wrong!?
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
<i>You'll</i> take him.
Someday.
Time.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
Why?
Did you think I wouldn't?
Either that or feeding the worms.
Nomak?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
From his father, of course.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
No, we can treat the wounds --
How can you be out here?
You're wrong.
How do I stop it?
I'm sorry, I --
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
For your miracle cure?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
For them. But for me --
I was afraid that might happen.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
You don't have to be.
No problem.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Inside the grave?
Something was wrong.
I guess--
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
You don't want it though.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
What'd you dream?
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
You have to go.
--no, I think they're all in there.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Something. Someone.
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
No.
Fucking owl!
Next time try putting on shoes--
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
--Domini!
No one ever comes here.
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Asleep--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net.
--shit!!!
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
What'd you say?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
I know, I know--
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
Heather.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--yes--
--the Sheriff's Office--
Who <u>is</u> this??
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
Well I do...
Abby...
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
See a guy.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Isn't that what you want?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
Listen, what is it? Is it done?
Got something to show me first?
So it would seem.
Jesus, I don't believe it...
Nah, I trust ya.
You said the usual--
Meurice...
What's that?
Tuesday.
What?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Okay.
Why do you do it?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Yes, but.
Then, shut up!
Bull.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
What do you want?
Yes.
No.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
See my breasts?  . See?
That's not crazy. I like you too.
. same here.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
I'm doing it.
Whatiya mean?
Shut up.
I'm glad you do.
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
I think I better go.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
Okay Frank.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Okay. yeah, call.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Okay. okay.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
... You look beautiful.
Just a minute.
No.
Probably not. no. Why?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
... Sandy?.
This is it.
Well. Okay.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Alright.
I'll get a coat for her.
You can change it if you want to.
Um-hmm.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Are you kidding?
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Ah, yes.  The murder.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Because I got caught.
No, my brother.
No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Diego?  It's George.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
George, are we gonna do this or not?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Touche.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
You fucked me, Diego.
In how long?  A week?
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
And Diego?
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Dad.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Are we gonna split up?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
What do you want from me?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
You swear?
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Because she's visiting me.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
The strike is a success; but ...
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sid Ahmed.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Why?
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Of course I am.
We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Cause?
Any prints on the nasal spray?
No.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
I didn't hear it.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Thank you.
No -- never.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
How long were you together?
I had a bad heart.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
Why do you think she left you?
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
No further questions.
That's all Dr. Paley.
You called him?
No.
Oriental medicine.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
High school?
Where did you meet him?
How?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
I suppose.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
You didn't know about it before that?
I thought the subject was sex?
Try.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
Sure.  Where to?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I went out on the boat.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Are you scared?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
That's crazy.
He could let you have your vacation.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
What time did you leave?
Well, I can help.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
What problem?
Michael.
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Well, I'd like to read them.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Heat is heat.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Oh, that'll be nice.
No.
WHAT!
Sure.
Must be nice having kids.
But I... We don't even know each other.
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
You sound like an artist.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
I bet you could do a book.
Because I already tried once.
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
WHY?
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
It's only four days.
Nah.
Betty.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
Damned if I know.
Climb out to where?
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Those 'fools' are my people.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
What?
Hush, baby.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I have to finish this for class.
I lied.
Who?
How do you know?
Fuck it.  Alright.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Dad?
Don't call me that.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
You haven't?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
You want to get into this now?
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
You don't need a key.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
There's no time.
Violet, please!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
No.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Not until he has the money!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Sure.
No.
Are you okay, Violet?
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Good guess.
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Thanks.
How long have you been with him?
Because it's the truth.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
Yes.
He was in love with you, right?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Good.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Shit!  Oh shit!
Caesar wants me to stay.
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
So now you know.
That's all I get?
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Yeah, I know...
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
-- sir? --
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Really.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
What?  Like amnesia?
That's what I'm saying.
No.
-- you could put it together --
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
Anytime.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- just --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
I didn't know this would happen.
-- how? --
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
You could do that?
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
Not really.
I'm sorry.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
So now you're asking for a student visa?
All of them?
I don't know.
...ditioning.
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
What? How do you know my name?
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Her name is Jill.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Well, I ...
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
You killed him?
He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
They weren't at school with us.
Jack ...
Is it stamped?
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Where are you taking me?
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Let go! We've got to stop!
What?
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
No you're not!
Yes.
But if they did promote you
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Hang on.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Try next of kin.
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Yes.
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You're not listening, mother.
This isn't rare!
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Um ...
No need, sir
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Not ... as such ...
Ha!!
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
She say she in great pain.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Mary said you might be coming.
Where is she?
I should be going. I just quit.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
No.
He's going to be all right, right?
The first is always the best.
You never know.
Yes.
Did you see my father?
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
You asked me not to come.
Because you can barely walk.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
God help us, he's hungry too.
She's no whore, Marcus.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Three legs.
Crazy fucker.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
What do you want to break?
Why?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
You learn that in the army?
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
You're crazy.
Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
Relax, will you.
You have the job you have...
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
They booted me out of Washington.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Yes.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
We can cut back at the end.
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
This is important to me.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
Yeah --
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Yes.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
Right there, Bobbie.
How do I get out of here?
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Nobody else had it.
I don't know.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
Hey?
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Oh, good.
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
Because you're nuts.
That's not it.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
That's yes?
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
I knew what you meant.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
It's better when you let me say it.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
I can't be.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
Not anymore!
You're breaking my concentration!
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Honest?
Of course...it's wonderful.
Murdered man.
Carla...
Walter!  Jeez!
All about me...
You think I'm creative?
Walter, I'm sorry...
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Hm.
I'm honored to know this man.
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I do the research.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Telling you what?
Smack?
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
Good morning Walter!
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
What's the matter with you!
Shut up!  You let him have it!
I had him in my grasp.
Coach knows what abs are?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Amazing!
Bummer metaphor.
You didn't like them.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Would you sleep with them?
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
I'm fine.
Hi, guys.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Mmmnkay.
Nothing.
Hi.
So I noticed.
Buffy.
Is that your car?
Water.  Okay.
I'll back that up.
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Come again?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
Pretty shallow of you.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
I forgot.
Get out of my facial.
Am I in trouble or something?
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Yes.
Lothos.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Oh.
You are such a wet.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Why?  Why me?
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
You think so?
Good.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Well, I hope so.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Wit-tay.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
--but you're father's in there!
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
Let me.
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
You okay?
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
No.
Yeah...you a witch?
I can do that, too.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
I told him.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
What?
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Okay...
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
Jim looking for somebody.
Ain't here.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
What are you talking about?
Hello, Senator.
You were never my guest?!
You were wandering around.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
Lester...
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Ohhh...
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Yeah.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Four aces, Doc.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
What?
All right, Ace?
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
No, I don't wanna come -
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
And at the...
What - what, Caesar's?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
How do you do?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Good to meet you.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Yeah, refill'd be great.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Well, sir, I was just...
I...
Okay. 
Ginger's mission in life was money.
That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.
Thanks a lot.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Yeah.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
But as much as they loved her...
...they didn't know what really moved her.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
You can trust me.
I didn't take your pills.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
What's it...
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
And where'd you go?
She had the same.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Get out of here.
You gotta go back out there.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Hi. Good.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Well, I've been busy. 
I'll to the FBI!
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Oh.
Oh, thanks, Eddy.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
And I mean... that's no good.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Are you sure?
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
He's good. He's fine.
Yeah, no shit.
Sure.
Yeah.  Thanks.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
I'll be there.
Bye.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
I did what you told me to.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
I'm always here for you.
I am.
It means I got the money.
He was just on the phone.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
I think that's it.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Come here, come here.
Every night, on the couch.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
They'll do it.
Fuck you!
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
Ch-Charlie M!
Kill you,  You motherfucker you!  Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
How you doin'?
You're a little confused?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I know, but that's enough.
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
Enough.
You turned around!
Nothing. How's your hand?
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Any place.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Or relieve me of it later.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
Bullshit.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
Who smashed the phone?
I don't want to know --
Because you know you'll be killing us.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
26th off Wilshire.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
No.
She's gone --
Your husband?
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Whose money is this?
The guy with the transplant.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
You knew about me.
You're enjoying this too much.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
259-7881.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
Whatever you say.
There are no guarantees in this life.
We can be there.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
Stay there.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
I still don't see you.
You should've done all this before.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Five minutes.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Seems not.
There's no lady here.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Yeah.
Then why doesn't she?
Now, that was a look.
An excellent quality.
Please, Dil --
Not in my experience.
Off his wages.
How'd you guess?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Yes, please.
Must be in love to manage that.
How different?
I think you do.
Yeah.
All the time.
Don't call me that.
Yeah. I care, Dil.
I said stop it.
I know that.
Make it up to me, then.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
So they do know.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
A little.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Delirious.
You following me?
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
Afraid so.
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
My pills...
Let me go, Dil
Whatever you say, Dil.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Yes. Now.
Stop it, Dil --
What's that supposed to mean?
Have a look at him.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You may be right.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
Thanks.
Yes.
Who'd you think it was?
I know that.
And who is she?
So, what do I look like?
No?
Well, I could say the same about you.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
Don't I know it.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Don't be so sure.
Do you?
Yes.
How can I?
Stop that talk now --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You don't know me, do you?
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
How was I leading you on?
Relax -- you're gaining.
Why?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Only we call them agents.
Agent.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
But no one actually saw him die.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
Or you --  Or you --
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Carson Dyle is dead.
I'm not fifteen.
Okay.
Who told you to do that?
Tuesday.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
Alex --
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
I dare you.
I don't think I know that one.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
What do you want?
Stop it!
Swiss.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
No, Jean-Louis.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Yes.
Good for you.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Yes, but we're divorced.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
Are you in the book?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Doing what?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Come on. You can't stay here.
You mean you and me?
Do you tell lies?
Words can hurt very much.
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
You do?
I never fucked Rod.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
I get the imports.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Are you sure?
It can't be.
She just turned off her light.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Sure.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Yes.
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
You eventually have to talk to him.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
OK. increase the peace.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Ok.
Stag?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
I need to ask you something.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Don't make me order you.
Attacked how?
You didn't believe her?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
How could you?
Two men left town right after it happened.
You're not telling me something.
Who was the fourth?
Told you to hide it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Yes. Unfair to me.
Since when does...
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
 No.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
I need your help.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
Come on, get in the truck.
Are you kiddin'?
Damn.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Yeah, borrowed!
...fine.

Okay.
...-cho and a hijack-...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
...do we?
Okay. 
Oh, shit.


 Shit. 
 Go on.
 Go, go.
Taking it down the hill.
You're--?  What?!
 All right.  Hey.


This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
So I took his truck, yeah.
You know.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
I mean, if that gun was...
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...

Yeah, baby!
...deal with this asshole.
...man.




...to him. 
Stop.

Hang...

  I've got the real thing!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
Forty-nine point four.
 It says forty- nine.
Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?
 There's gotta be...
Sorry.



We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Always the negative...
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
 Yeah.
Thank you very much.
...about him.
Listen, shithead!
Three seconds.  One...
I did what I could for you...
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
We do need your truck.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.

What the hell's a sage?
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
We've got it...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...

Is it--?
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Went away? 
Almost quaint.
Good to see you again, Leo.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...

Not tonight...

I don't know what the hell...

Where's Elvis?!
Dead, last time I...
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...-time,  remember?
...somehow. 
Uh, we both like to fish.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
You got thirty minutes.
Here's what I want you to do.
I will tell you what I...
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

How much longer for the range and power projections?

INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Thanks.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
Maybe.
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Where is she?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
Okay.
Why?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
How do you happen to know her?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
And why's that?
C'mon I'll show you.
What's the maid's address?
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Mrs. Mulwray?
What do you mean?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
That your maiden name?
No reason.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Never forgave him for what?
Get in the car.
I gave everybody the night off.
What were you doing there?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Do? To who?
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
...That's not what I meant.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
He didn't wear bifocals.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
You'll find one of those people.
Don't know her. Take a number.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Hope so. He's working for us.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Yes...
Never.
That's what I thought. You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife.
What about the water?
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Sure you do.
Mr. Gittes...
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
He was expecting you?
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
What about?
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
Well, you never know, do you?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Elena. My name's Elena.
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
But...who...
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 
Then where's the money?
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
So what's that got to do with it?
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Enthusiastic?
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Certainly not.
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -

As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Of course.
Emily!
It may not be about anything at all.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
No.  They've passed on.
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Well, I -
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
What?
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
Are you finished?
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Rawlston is my boss.
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
Yes.
Sure.
Yes, sir.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Think again!
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
What about that apartment?
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
I take it she likes the guy.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
He went home to change for the big date.
There's no light back there.
You're kidding.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
Just now.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
Well... kind of, sort of?
How do you know that?
What?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Jesus, you're caustic.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Sang.
He's not invited.
So what are you saying?
Oh God...
With this guy locked in?
I'll assess all I want!
I can whip your ass.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
Shocking abuse of authority.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
She called me Brad.
I'm talking to myself here.
I think it's safe to say yes.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc�.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
All right, Vader's boss...
Yeah.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
So they build another Death Star, right?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
I guess not.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
Because you buckled.
At least we're stuck here together.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Exactly. They drank it all.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Jesus.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I'm going with you.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
I swear.
Yeah, but at what a price.
You know.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Just... go! Go open the video store.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
To talk to you.
I'll call you. Let you know.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Just the paper.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Jesus Christ, what next?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
They are not.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Nothing personal.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
You used to go out with her?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
She's my girlfriend.
Meaning?
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I was kidding.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
And I actually date you?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
HOW MANY?
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
And that made you feel better?
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
I don't want Caitlin...
I don't want to go back with her...
Fuck you.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
He is.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
Well, how about these two movies? 
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I'll see you there.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks.
No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
We'll never know, will we?
My pleasure.
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Help me!  I don't want to die!
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
Oh, please.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
Did I miss something?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
You know me, I'm a night person.
I can't believe you just said that.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Yeah?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Breathtaking.
Up ahead.
Don't let me fall!
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Take the rope.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Forget it!  I refuse!
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
What are you talking about?
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
Then it's a deal.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Let's move your ass in there!!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Help me, sir?
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house.
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Crime?
Yes, sir.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Vitamins will it be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
Big, big money.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Four in this block, sir.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Most of the time.
Max, the cab driver!
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Of course.
What?  What did you say?
Wouldn't dream of it.
Very generous.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
So?  It was a random thing.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
It's nothing.
Tell me about it.
I'm standing right here.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
What happens if you don't?
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
It's not that kind of job.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
I don't think I can do this.
I'm trying...
It's not me.
I tried it.
So?
How can you kill him like that?
No you don't.
What?
No.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
It's not bullshit.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
In case he asks.
I don't know.
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
No, not just that.
It's what I do for a living.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
Geronimo?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Why the hell not?
I, uh, I have some problems.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Not for years.
I can't promise you anything.
I think you're different.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Yeah.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Pretty scary, huh?
Getting rid of my hub!
How is it possible?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Where then?
You will?
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
Connecticut.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Is that what they told you?
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
What about you?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
<u>Why you</u>?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Only on the football field.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I want to believe you, too.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
What do you suggest?
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
Tell me.
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Oh?  How's he doing?
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
And a hundred mile airspace.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Could we hear God?
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
That's my scientist.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
What kind of deal?
I didn't realize I was out.
A page-break signal.  A period.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
The systems integration site.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
You sonofabitch.
You too.
That you, Valerian?
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Now you know.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
You're willing to die for this.
It's late.  We should go back.
Oh.  I brought you something.
I'm sorry.
What?
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
Hi.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
But --
Buck is a deal.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
What are you doin' here?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
I don't know, Boss.
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
What for?
You tryin' to say somethin'?
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
What you mean, Luke?
On my own.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Call.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Kick a buck.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I was?  How you spell that?
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
What book?
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
Is he out?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
I'm giving you Clint outside.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
They get fan letters...
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
Not yet.
Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
They all have one...
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Tell it to your shrink.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
Helen Hudson...
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
It is?
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
James.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I did this already.
Yeah, and a dimple.
I want to see my mother immediately.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
What?
There's nothing to tell.
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Ruth's already taken him home.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
A deal's a deal.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
Lie?
I guess so. I think that's right.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Exactly.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
What's my rap?
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Tell the doctor.
I don't like lamb.
Lie down.
List schmist. You'll remember.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Shhhh.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
The restaurant, too?
I couldn't even face that one.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
Why'd you tell?
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
I think I should call someone.
Yeah, the plans.
Letty, please.
She's only known the guy a few months.
I mean tonight.
You can get out of the dinner.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
Especially now.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Who?
I love him.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I heard about your friend.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
What?
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
How about if I call you?
Thank you.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Where are you from?
Cops?
And the Vodka.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I think he's already figured that out.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
We have to find Sophie.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
A thousand dollars?
-- Did you set it up?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Hard to say.
Everything.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
The Holiday Hotel.
Go look.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
What is it you do, Sami?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
We both know I'm already dead.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
It's my idea.
Mr. Taylor?
God, I want to go home.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
No.
No!
You see that car?
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
Tonight.
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
What's it to you?
You don't seem to understand.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
I'll give them to you.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Jen...
What was it?
Perhaps.
What have you discovered?
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
Well, we had talked...
I knew she would intrigue you.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
I don't know...
But the sword could be in his compound.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
Care for a hot dog?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
It's only a flesh wound.
You're welcome.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
You gotta go now, I bet.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
Yes.
Fine with me.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
On my mother's life.
Why not?
You did?
Oh really?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
The Fountainhead.
I never said that.
Shut up.
No thank you.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
That's also none of your business.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I don't.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Where did you say she's from?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Greg McConnell.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
I don't think that bothered him.
Are you shitting me?
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
Do you want to learn or not?
Why?
I don't know.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
Cool.
But I thought high school is only four years.
I'm sorry.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Jesus!
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
What do you mean?
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Outstanding.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
And if I win?
Be more specific.
Okay.
No.
But who will they turn to for help?
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Nothing.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
Tell me all the details.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Is that so?
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
Do you know when she'll be back?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
It's really important.
How will I get to her?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
She was very pretty.
I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
Times have changed.
That's right.
What do you mean?
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
It's your play.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Where did you mail them?
I didn't forget.
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
Will you be friend for always?
But you must!
This is more fun than just pretend.
But why?
That's a fine-looking ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
Will you come soon?
No, thank you.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
And Amy mailed them?
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Translation: a total geek.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Why would they exaggerate?
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
And then?
I wonder if he's married.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Give him the tampon test.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
I think he called you beautiful.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
No they're not.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
DON'T call the police.
You should have seen it erect.
Ignore it.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
So what do I do?
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
So you're Grant's secretary?
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Used to? Did it stop finally?
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Briefs.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
No, I said it was our first date.
Take some allergy medicine.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
He's seriously disturbed...
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isn�t with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, how�s your mother?
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Who?
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
It must be a closet or something.
No.  I mean...  that isn�t necessary.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Oh... Okay.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Great.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
No...
Check his kids.
Nobody's got clean kids.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Oh.  Excuse me.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You could buy it on payments.
A teleprompter.
What?
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
What do you mean?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
What?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
Yeah.
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
Uh...
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
Home.
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I sure fall for some weird guys.
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I missed...
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
All set.
Come on.
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
Curse?
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Ain't no place safe.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
What?
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
They're townies?!
Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
Yep.
Except sex.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
I'm sorry.  I, we
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
What happened?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
It's better than doing nothing.
Uh-huh.
Yes sir.
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
A barbaric yawp.
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
I have something.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Oh..
He's the owner...
Why don't you want a message sent?
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
And where is our point of arrival?
You're going to have to get a new one.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Dead.
I told you...
You hear that?
Jesus Christ lady...
I don't know...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Anti social?
Self sufficient...
Takes one to know one.
On the side!!
What?
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Hey! Come out here!
Shut up!
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
John,we're going huntin'.
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Who? Who is?
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
Married?
Nick...
What hospital is he in? Where?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
Linda, yeah.
No.
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda, what's the matter?
Will you marry me?
Sure.
But --
What?
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
Up north.
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
Right.
Huh?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
You got it.
I thought you might be praying.
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
What do you mean?
Three bullets -- minimum.
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
What?
Here. Behind you.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Yeah!
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
I want this bastard brought down.
I'd think about it.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Out of the room.
I'm not voting for you.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
How do you know?
Bacon cheeseburgers.
I was set up.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
I'll be okay.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Not too good.
...Have you been drinking?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You be careful.
And you should be with your family.
What's it mean?
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
We will --
Of course I will.
Thank you, Belle --
You're lying.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Anybody can see that.
Not me! 
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
I don't care.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
He was --
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
How much?
Coming.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Mary -- it's gone.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Tired?
You'll never change -- will you?
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Thanks, Mary.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
Helps sometimes to say it.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Do you really think that?
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
It don't matter!
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Cup for cup!
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
So, you divorced of what?
But meant her moving here.
So, why didn't you come?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
Tell me about it.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Sure.  Follow me.
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
I still feel like shit.
Roy?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
Well, how'll I get home?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Oh, yeah, I will...
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
Yeah...
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
Well...
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
I like that... yeah!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
What kind of things, Leon?
I got Sal.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
What do you want?
Yeah ...
I want to talk to him.
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
Mulvaney...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Sure - we like you.
I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
Did you always call him Junior.
Yeah.
My body?  What for?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
But I want to know what you think.
We won't have to.
Alive.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
Okay.
Okay, Sonny.
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Open this up!
They're beautiful ...
I said you were never a faggot.
<i>Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont Williams. I own the Williams Brothers armored car service.</i>
On a raid. If she wants to see justice... we gonna take Domino to the Jungle, baby. <b> EXT. JUNGLE -- NEXT </b> The El Camino pulls into the entrance to the JUNGLE. The neighborhood of LOW INCOME HOUSES winds upward into the HILLSIDE adjacent to the wall. Ed parks the El Camino next to the curb. <b> INT. EL CAMINO -- NEXT
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
I don't know. They might be dead already.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
He said... take his right arm.
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
In theory.
I be.  I'm living large.
Is that the only tape you got?
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
You got my back.
I own a brownstone on this block.
Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
You're a drunk fool.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
How old are you?
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
It's gonna be hot today.
I'm going with you.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
What is?
What?
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Se�or Love Daddy's show to you.
Depends.
Tonight, when we close.
Here, you gotta delivery.
Quit bullshitting.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Do I love you?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Shit!  I forgot.
How long then?
Tina, it's not like that.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Magic Johnson.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
I didn't know you could read.
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
That's right.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
That's what you think?
I ain't getting shit.
I know.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Too many pizzerias already there.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
You did?
Would you like something to drink?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
I don't follow.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Oh, of course.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Will not.
Where did you learn that word?
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
Put some ice on it.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
You have beautiful eyes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Hey, let's go spy on them.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
That's gross.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
That's not your tape.
Uh-oh. Harry?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Oh wow. Look at you.
Yes!
It's a surprise.
The evidence of what?
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Are you going to kill her?
What does Leto say, Piter?
Nothing.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
Yes...
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
They tried and died.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
I didn't feel well...
Goulash.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Don't you have any savings?
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
Rolling.
This is kind of a stream--
Ed, it was only one review.
You met Basil Rathbone!
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
That's ridiculous.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
I told you this was gonna happen.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
That's not true --
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Oh, of course!
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
We're escaping!
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Who?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Oh.  My condolences.
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Who's Dr. Tom?
Let's get married.
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Went --
Oh, Al ... This is just...
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
What?
Um, yeah -- thanks.
Great line.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Ed --
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
He made a mistake.
No! And that girl has a name.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
The doctor said you were having sex.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
She wouldn't tell me.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Never would be plenty.
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Who's in it?
I hear the dog really liked him.
Ha!
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
I missed you.
Yeah, well...
The what?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
That's lucky.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Shari, I really like you...
So...?
Twenty-nine.
No. It's your fault.
What?
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What are you drunk?
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Yeah.
Ray, come an--
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Hi, Shari.
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
Oh, man! So...
Thanks... That's ...
Hm?
Good?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
El/ella -
Anything wrong?
Yeah, just --
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
Yeah?
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
You bet.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Looks like today's your lucky day
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Good for you.  Good for you
I've got an idea.
You'll be fine.
Walt needs to see you.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Should we get a what?
Still clear?
Three twenty-five.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
What do you mean?
What'd I do?
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Yeah.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
We talked.
This business, Captain?
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Call me Dudley.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
She told you?
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
What about him?
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
What do you mean?
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
I never truck with no sissies!
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
Answer yes or no.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Why?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
No.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
I want you to follow Bud White.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What?
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
How about White?
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Some reality.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Right now, before I back down.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Yeah.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Oh Jesus.
What'd he give to you?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Really?
Yes.
Okay.
Wait. What do I do?
What if--
You told me no calls.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Why?
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
What if--
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
With what?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Is that good?
Why?
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
A report?
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No.
For your wife?
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Have you been working with Rachel?
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
It's not real...  That's not me.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Well...yeah.
Stacy--
What is it?
Who?
It's a brand new card.
Here, you can use this.
Don't count on it.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
It is fish.
Brill.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You're not.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I gotta go.
That's temporary.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I'm sorry about that.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Oh, well, that's true.
Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
Can I open 'em up?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
No, but they took my blender.
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Why would the NSA--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
So do I!
Yeah.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Fuck you.
What?
I said fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
I just meant--
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
You're kidding me.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
No.
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
You sew very badly.
You don't sew at all!
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
No.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
I can't move.  I can't get out.
We've got to get you out of here.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but�  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Shut-up!
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
I don't know.
Bonjour.
You were in Africa?
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
I liberated it.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
For?
Is there a song you don't know?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't� I couldn't even do that properly.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
I don't think it's indifference.
Hey! -

The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I've met you before.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
I mean home.  India.
I'll always go back to that church.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Pardon me?
I was looking forward to this evening.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Go away.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
The windows don't open.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
How close?
Don't overestimate yourself.
No you can't.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
That's my girl.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
A dozen times.
Charged?
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Something like that.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
It's your mistake.
A billion dollars.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
My job, my rules.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Parachute.
But that's all behind us now.
I'm sorry.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
The disc is still in there.
Go!
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You mean the seven billion.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
And you do it so well.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
You are a miracle worker.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
You look like George Washington.
We're supposed to.
You change partners, you change the rules.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
They did?
The what?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
Lemme see it, will you?
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
That's crazy -- why not?
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
Whoa.  No shit.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
Uh-huh.
And if you had to guess ...
Erin --
Erin?  What are you --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Corey.
That's right.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
It happens all the time.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
You got more than one?
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Better safe than sorry.
Thanks for reminding me.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
About what?
What's that?
I need it.
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Uh-huh?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Soon, Lord Vader.
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
And that is why I must go.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Because of my father, I guess.
Our destruction?  Who?
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
What is it?
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
What is it?
Would you please stop calling me that?
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
... just remember that, �cause I'll be back ...
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
I always said you were a gentleman.
I'll bet.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
You may call me Leia.
Thanks.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
I understand.
What is it?
What did you say?!
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
Jabba the Hutt?
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
I see a city in the clouds.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
But we saw Earth destroyed.
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Humans?
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
You told me he was dead.
What?
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Don't lie to me.
I see your point. What's the favor?
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
Somebody get off!
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
So what does this thing do?
Not you?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Yeah, kinda.
Sewers. Come on.
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
Yeah.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Move aside!
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Of Merlin?
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Well hurry then, and get it.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
Without Lancelot?!
Because you and the land are one.
Why?
Me?
To me? But why?
It is.
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Yes.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What didn't he tell you?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Phonograph.
Storage.
Want to ask him?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Depression?
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
I'm Father Karras.
On what?
I beg your pardon?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
What kind of stuff?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
He's nice.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
You like him.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Okay.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
So what's wrong with her?
Oh, Christ.
I stole it.
I came to say goodbye.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Withering Heights.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
You and Regan?
Holy water.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Can you give her something?
Always.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Come on!
Who?
O'Lord hear my prey.
Yes?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Just the same.
Frank.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
How will he eat?
Get your hand off me.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Says who?
Her hands.  Like that.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
That's what we agreed.
It never was.
Yeah, fine.
Right.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
How long you been at it?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
What are you talking about?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
A useless talent.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
Be reasonable, Jack.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
What's it for?
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
Fuck you.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Yeah, fine.
Good choice.
This'll kill 'em.
Yeah.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
Just call me a cab.
All right.
I'm sorry?
What do you mean?
So run a little longer.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
What's wrong with it?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Yeah.
Huh?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Funny job.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
All right.  Hold on.
Frank works hard.
Pretty much.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Forget it.
Can't sleep?
Better than that.
You're upset.
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Hi.
I didn't want to wake you.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
The recent past.
None?
Eddie.
How old is he?
Something good?
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Would it?
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Don't count on it.
Five seconds.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
Have fun at work.
No.
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Really. So you�re projecting what, a tad over two million?
I�m sure you do...
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You�re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
It�s not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. We�re not sure which one, Julia�s on it right now. Word is they�re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we should�ve been prepared for this.  We�re in trouble here, Jack...
I think I could figure it out.
Mom liked it.
Ah. A classic...
Maybe I don�t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
It�s just two kids, right?
Pretty much.
I don�t care if you�re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can�t park here.
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we�re a mom and pop operation, we�re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
No.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
You mean because you thought I was cocky I�m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of �em take a couple seconds...  ...some of �em take a lot longer...
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids� recital.
Frank.  Where�s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Mr. Mintz?  I don�t think so...building�s closed pal.  You�ll have to come back tomorrow.
I don�t care who you are.  It�s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
I know we�ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
I don�t know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Jack...don�t even start...
Because you�ll be here.
She�s your dog, Jack.
You�re having a bad day, I�ll go with you...actually, there�s no way in hell you�re gettin� me back out there...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there�s no question about that.  But this...  ...you�ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Surprise.  We�re pregnant...  Yeah...that must�ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Oh yeah, you�re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I�m gonna take you to that special place...
Wait a minute.  You�re my wife?
Way out...
Look, you�re making this into something it�s not. This isn�t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It�s a step forward...  Don�t you see?  I�m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Promise me again...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let�s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Kate? No, there�s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
No...I�m not...
Tonight.
I've got plenty of places to go.
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight�s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
Five times.
He's made a few changes.
I should have done more, run more tests --
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Give me a mirror...
It's easy for you to be patient.
What do you mean "complete"?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
It's been changed.
What?  What do you mean you --
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Excuse me?
Are you kidding?
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Why didn't you say something?
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
What're you getting at?
Brain injury.
And take a little trip with them...
Trip? Where to?
You mean <I'm> going along?
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
How are you, Miss Peterson?
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
That line was tampered with...
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Was there any damage?
The Wall's transparent...
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Drop that fucking money!
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Yeah.
Yah.
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
Oh, geez.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Ya got that right.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Chaska.
In what way?
Can you be any more specific?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Ya kiddin'!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
No, I -
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Dad's here.
No, no, fax is -
Yah.
Yah.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
2:30.
Yah.
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Yah, woulda been cold out here.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah.
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Well, yah, I was married. I was married to - You mind if I sit over here?
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
Norm?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
What'd he say?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
No.
Linda Cooksey?
Copy.
There's the car! There's the car!
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
He's at Norstar.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
You need to make these your primary "action items."
What does that mean?
Can't you give me something?
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Really?
What the hell are you doing here?
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Here.
Chloe's dead.
Guy or girl?
We did make love?
Say my name.
Marla, no, wait...
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Marla...
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
... You know me?
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Tyler Durden.
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
There's always that.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
What list?
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
It isn't... ?
You quit?
Work.  Going to work.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
I want to know --
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
Tyler...
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
"Applicant?"
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
What... what are you saying?
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
If you know, I know.
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
I'm doing this for us.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
What?
What?
Very good, Sir.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
It's free to all.
You're welcome to join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?!
Let go of me!!
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
Six duds in a row.
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
He probably already knows we're coming.
Taken care of.
We need to hurry.
Random, sure.
What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
Blow me.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
May we come in?
What was the fight about?
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
How do you know?
I wasn't worried about us.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I know, Dad.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Right. April 25th.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
I know who you are.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Nothing we can do, man.
How much we got left in that minigun?
Crazy motherfucker.
Let's go.
Sorry, Sir.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
What?
He... took it.
Black.  No sugar.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
What that?
I say we tape him to a chair.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Well, there's nobody special!
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Yeah!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
No.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
A list.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Yes.  They're free.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
The Little People?
A quest?
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...
Parry... I'm Jack.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
What are the other reasons?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Oh...like Moses.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
There isn't any more to tell.
What are we about to do?
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
You said.
Now, now.
No, dammit, I would easy.
That's right, hand.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I'm going on over there...
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Bobby, don't talk like that...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
No. We have tomatoes.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
Oh.
Yeah, me, too...
Tita, I've got to go...
Sometimes.
With applesauce?
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Thank you.
Why?
Something witty and devastating like that.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Just give me a chance, will you?
That'll make you happy.
Thanks, Carl...
What?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Alright.
So what's her name?
A play-ya.
Just chill.
You look good.
I buy them flowers.
I kissed those girls.
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
Where you goin'?
C'mon.
Eddie from Compost?
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Which one?
She lives near Eddie?
Um, yeah I think so.
Wha'?
A girl named Amanda.
Positive.
Positive.
Nah.
God I admire you.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Joan or Margaret Smith.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
You don't know me.
Where am I?
Thank you.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
My lawyer was a bum.
Are you serious?
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Velma.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
Hi Gummy. How�s the eye?
Fletch?
What's that?
Wait here for me, Gummy.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Take it where?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Not me.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
You've met her?
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Why did you do it?
No.
Bastard.
They just left, sir.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I commend him on his choice
Why not? Oh shit... really?
Utah?
What about finding the source?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Print this Frank.
No, I ain't got you...
Who's your decorator?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Actually, you may take it all now.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Did she tell you anything?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Exactly.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Three hundred.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
What?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
I don't need it that bad.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
'Booty Time.'
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
What's fine?
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
What?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Sal --
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Une erreur!  C'est g�nial.  C'est une vedette � la t�l�vision.  Il peut aller partout sans �tre soup�onn�... En plus il a besoin de fric.
But will they?
You're for real?
Yeh?  Who else?
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Marseilles.
When ya go back on?
He coulda been white.
Policy man in Queens.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
Why is it called Hellgate?
I'll go find Hayes.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
You alright?
Did he?
Hello, Frank.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Get him home safe.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
I don't know.
I'm thirty-five years old.
1998.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
What?
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
I'm glad.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She just died, your mother just died?
October 22, 1969.
Whatta you mean...
I don't know...  What about the other women?
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
In my pocket.
What...
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
What the hell is that smell?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
What?
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
I hear that.
Same thing.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
I'll think of something.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Your bed.
I don't know.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Gulp!
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
Stop the car!  Now!!
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Don't say any more.
I have to.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
We're gonna scare him?!
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
I hope so.
Yeah, we're here.
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
The what?
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Look, I don't want your money!
Good night, beautiful.
Next, you dial a number.
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
What are you going to do?
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Right.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
The fire alarm...
Don't be ridiculous!
They're out of town.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
I'm staying.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Just felt a little chill.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
After your parents passed away?
What do you mean???
Just radio for help, okay???
You are going where?
Ruptured steam pipe.
Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
What happened eighteen months ago?
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
Don't wait Efor me.
It's your best play, Nicky.
How do you Eknow.
Let's work on it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Is it?
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
I have a class. I'm late.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'm not sure.
Packs an emotional wallop.
A flat-out hit.
What else?
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
Joanne Bourne.
It violates so many trusts.
Life is good.
You're hurting my head.
Since when did that matter?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew's my grandson.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Why does it matter?
I have excellent long-term memory.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What color?
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Would you like to meet him?
But you're his friend.
Someone waiting for you?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
I am your wife.
Stop!
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I thought you were against fighting.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Hm.  Is it?
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
That was England.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
I congratulate them.
He's "discovering" India.
It's over.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
It would be five thousand more.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
Something's not right.
Where did you get this?
Surely you know what you have.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
He was still warm when they confirmed.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
A day or so.
They think I offed the Director.
I'm sure I could have.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Again?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
German, is that you?
Why not?
Not that.
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
We were just looking.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
New policy.
I'll take care of my end.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Fatter... some things never change.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Yeah... I know.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
I don't want to go there.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
You sent me to him.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
He must have.
Texas is a big state.
I can handle it.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
When they find it, they find it.
Can we make it?
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
We walk.
I never have any luck.
Chicago.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
You serious?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
Two years.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Was the steering faulty?
I know.
Well?
Jack, you're wrong.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Good evening.
Yes you can.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
I can't.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Once a week?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
And what was that?
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
You've been watching the film.
Yeah.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
And you didn't know her last name?
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Yes.
I see.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
I'll call the police.
Think about it.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
No, I didn't know that.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Making a living.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Nasty way to go.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Shut up.
Knock it off, Gerald.
What? And get the clap?
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
That's right.
No.
To get on the...
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
They came in and they, you know...
That's right?
...that's right...
For some sales pro...
Starting up.
What act?
That's what I...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Should do something to them.
Yes.
No, we're just...
No.
What did you say?
You're actually talking about this?
What did he say?
Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
You.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
That's none of your fucking business...
They're ancient.
Clear...
What?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Where were you?
Why?
You think so?
Will you excuse us please?
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Excuse me, sir...
Not lately it isn't.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
You want something off the B list?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Did you tell 'em my sale?
No.  It hadn't.
You're so full of shit.
What sales?
Because I don't like you.
You sold eight Mountain View?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
"Always be closing..."
Like you taught me...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Yes.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Go ahead.
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. 
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
I don't know.
Yes.
To...you know.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I told you.
She wants her money back.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I...
What...?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
When...
Why not?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
John...
 Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
I got surprises for everybody!
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Tom is right.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
He's the head of the family.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
I understand...
I want you to help me, Fredo.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
I've always taken care of you.
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
Chi?
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
He is, I believe, a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
Where?
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
Michael.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Let him gamble.
I do not.
You were unfair with them.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Some water.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
He supports me.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
Sure.  I loved it.
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
You will not hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
You don't say?  Which picture?
That's exactly what I intend to do.
This David's a friend?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Why not?
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
I was an officer.
You're the one who started it.
Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
Do I look okay?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
Do I have any other choice?
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
I'm very sorry.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
What won't do?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Then who did?
So what do I do?
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
Yes?
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
She is beautiful.
Of course.  This afternoon.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Righto.  Let me see.
What kind of job... ?
A boost. A big boost ...
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
Get out of here, then. Now.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Something like that -
Consider me gone, Detective --
Needs brightening ...
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
We're partners here --
You mean the poor --
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
You know where the others are?
You getting my checks ... ?
I know, sir ...
You guys are through...
We'll take it...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno ...
You all right -- ?
Sure --
Okay --
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
Me...
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Thank-you ...
I'm cool.
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
I gotta get my tool --
Where we going -- ?
DO IT! NOW -- !
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
On account of me.
And here I am...
Six or seven...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
That's what I want ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Bench seats.
Of course. Hi, Junie --
And the moral of that story is -- ?
No we don't -
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
Who's "Eleanor?"
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Why don't you leave him alone?
Checkin' it out
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Jezuz Christ!
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
What did he say, exactly?
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
Yeah.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
Yeah.
Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
Somethin's in my room.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
What're you doing?
Really?
What're those?
That's right.
It's an integer proof.
Half-red, half-black--
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
That's enough.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--And confuse him--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
Who is he?
I don't got a crush on her.
How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
Probably not.
What did you think?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Maybe what mea--
You've never been on a plane.
And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
Where were you?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
I guess.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Do you want to talk about it?
I'll keep in touch.
Only if you grab my ass.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
How was that?
How the hell did you do that?
I've never seen your place.
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Just for fun?
So, do you play the piano?
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
What am I scared of?
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Don't hold me so tight.
She got to make it.
Short fella. Pale face.
Two.
Government.
*You* find out, I can't.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Excuse me for asking.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Just around that next bend.
They never wrote you nothing?
All right, you remember the *man* then.
I ain't gonna run.
Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
What's the matter? What's happened?
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Lookin' for a job?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Take her with you!
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Don't taste bad.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Didn' you get no sleep?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
They killed Casy first.
They know he got hit in the face.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Good-by, Tommy.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
Ain't no whisky, is they?
California, here we come!
I wisht it was day.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Whatsa matter?
Morning.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
It's what I do.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
I'm Martin Blank.
Don't say that.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Here is now there. There is here.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
It's always the little things.
Bad television.
Seven it is.
I'll think about it.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
What stuff?
You understand the psychology of the job.
It's only natural....
Up on the right.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Those all seem kind of related...
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
In Portugal, yes.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
What's a revival tent?
Thank you.
As long as you had a good time.
Work's good for the soul.
To shoot you. Correct.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
How's that?
That's good.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
It is cocktail hour yet?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
A jogger, huh?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
She did?
You too.
Need a lift?
Poor thing.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Thanks.
How did you find out all that?
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
One more time.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Fine!
Doesn't matter.
What about him?
Yeah?
I don't care.
Little.
I didn't see it.
I think they call it a pasture.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
That's not true.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Sure.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Tch. What are you --
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
No.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Okay.
Good night.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Tubab means white man.
Where to?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Promise.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Of course not.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
We should be fine, then.
Of course I have.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
I wouldn't let happen.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I know where he goes.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
No, not yet.
Maybe... look -- just...
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
The sensitive type.
That's far out!
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Yeah?
Roger.
Dead?
Yeah, mom?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Hmmm.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Blow me.
We did it!
Think you can do better?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
Make it my first born.
You're not gonna win.
Do my ears deceive me?
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Excuse me?
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
What number please?
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
I don't know Brady.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Look.
What does that mean?
Go!
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
It's okay..it's okay.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Drive Carefully.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
I don't want to.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Why?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
You look sharp. You understand?
Why?
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
What's going on?
Uh huh.
What?
Behind that bush there.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Sure, see you later.
That's probably all he can do.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
No, he's not.
Totally...
YEAH?
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I found the car! He's here!
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Sure. Sure.
I don't like that story.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
What did he look like?
I promise.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
I'm scared...
But you can't kill the bogyman.
No! Do as I say.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
What did you use before?
Only minimum security.
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
I can't believe it!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Yeah.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
I can't resist.
We're actresses.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Well, are...are they big?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Hi.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
No, I don't have time.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Yes?
Everything's okay? 
How-how's Frederick?
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
I have been in love with you for so long.
Why?
Poor Hannah.
Is something wrong?
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
I know!  I know!
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Are you angry with me?
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
What are you going to use for money?!
No.
So you met somebody else?
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
But not you.
Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
I can't keep my mind on the show.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
You look so beautiful.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
How are you?
Y-yeah.
Oh...
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
I know...I know.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Isn't that great?
Well, then a third opinion.
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
...from Mavis, also.
Yeah.
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Oooo.
Look, everything's going your way.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
Well-well, like what?
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Well--
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
I was so bored!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah?
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Probably not.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, you can tell me.
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
When'd you get here?
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Mm-hm.
God.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
A reward for what?
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
You want me to be?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
And who is "they?"
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
That's why my wife adores me.
Seen what, sir..?
Show me the Pigs.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
The children...?
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
He is...?
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
...unmarked hundreds....
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
What'd you say, hon...?
Waal...
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Why did you look at me that way?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Where do you live?
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
No. 
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
...and my need for The Institution...
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
...and that is what you need to expand.
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
What shape is the scar?
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
...but:  this particular statue...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...I feel that...
...no.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
You are the prince of the darkness.
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]

Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
Because you're an idiot.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Never say never.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
You goddamn bitch!
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Don't talk to me like that.
Jealous much?
Yeah, I just got back.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
I didn't. Cherry.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Like a suicide thing?
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
I thought I...you..
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Come on through.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
Bye.
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
You have to let me go!
hurries over.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Saint Mario!
What???
You're such an incredible woman.
That idiot boarder?
Let's go overseas . . .
All right, then.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
I miss her. I miss my wife.
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
You just made that up.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Just get better okay?
Since what?
Really? Do tell.
Someone special.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
What?
But... I thought...
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
What?
Really? Why?
Where's my wife?
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
I surrender...
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
The homeless!
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
That's not what I mean...
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
Unprofessional.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Let's watch some TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
And the rent is okay?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
-- hospital.
-- institution.
Right.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Oh, that's fine.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
He'll never appreciate it more.
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
You could have a pool to cool off in.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Honey, are you okay?
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Where should I hide the car keys?
Oh, honey.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Isn't it?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
The thermometer's broken.
Can we keep him?
No.
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Really.
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
Talk to me about what?
We don't have any proof of that.
So?
What?
No.
It's late.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
That is what bothers me.
How long is the voyage?
Me?  Of course.
You.
It's done.
No -- I will.
Can you really tell from doing that?
How?
I cannot explain.
I remember you.
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Sorry.
And the other one -- he is like you?
Sounds very -- normal.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Why?
We'll see.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
It was stolen.
What do you want to do?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
There is no way out.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
What are you talking about?
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
I'm not going to die for this!
How about the cop?
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
We're trapped in a house.
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
They'll cut the power.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Keeps to himself, more like.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
Mars?  What are you doing?
Whatever.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
He said something about a girl --
What are we going to do about Mike?
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Where are they?
Tell her I'm almost home.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Go, Mickey.
Go, Mickey.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
We're okay.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
What do you want?
Smith will know.
Let me see your identity card.
Name a price.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Yes we have.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
You said you had no whiskey.
Get in.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
Today.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Business is good at the hotel?
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Fuck you.
You�re drunk.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Why sir?
The commander is not here.
Our cards, please.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
What?
You could have asked for a favor.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
Go out! Where?
You cannot go alone.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
A kiss.
Yes.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
It was substantial.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen.
Please, please try one more time.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
He has taken the presidential suite.
The lieutenant wants the register.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Who is this Simon?
-- bullshit --
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
C'mon.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Three times, to be exact.
Up here --
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Why?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
You need to get out more.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
I don't think so...
Why not?
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- that's the fact, bud --
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
It'll have to do.
He's gotta still be down here.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Question answered.
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
-- my loss --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
What?
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
He must've beaten us all here!
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
And you think it's in there?
He would have been back by now.
Oh, dear.
-- I'm coming --
We don't have proof of that.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Sure.
She's here.
My God, I heard something!
I want this one, daddy.
For good luck honey.
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
No.
What are you talking about?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
What are you getting at!
And what would you do?
Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
Where?
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
What?
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
And he still sits there?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Oh, Terri ...
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
Fuck you!
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Something like that.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
You sound disappointed.
Anna, I think you better stay....
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Yeah.  The big E.
A little petting is not the issue!
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Oh.  No.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
You certainly do.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
If you do anything to my friend...
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Please! Norville!
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
I know that, Amy.
Sure, Norville, sure...
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Now, Aim --
Watch it, Archer --
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Well, I --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
Say, that was a swell idea!
Well, why don't ya read it.
Wait a minute!
Well, I made the dean's list.
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Oh my God, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Damnit, where's my car!
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
She looks in her purse...
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Yes -- on the boat.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
Is she a doctor?
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Of course, Wes.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
Yes, thank you.
Of course not!
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
I love Fort Holland.
You didn't drive her mad.
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
What about her?
To the asylum?
Why?
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Elena.
Good night.
What do you think?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
That shirt?
You go dry off now.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Yeah, that one.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
C'mon.
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
You're not a psycho!
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Oh Wendy.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
I suppose. Why?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
They say you never forget.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Am I right or am I right?
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
I don't know.
Watching what?
Charles, what time is it?
What are you doing?
No.
That's all, for now.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
To do nothing.
That's right.
He's just rattling your cage.
I'm always all business.
Habit.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Best friend?
That's a long time.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Who?
What was it?
Thought you might find that.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Then so was mine...
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
No back-up.
Ah! You have questions?
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
It will grow back again!
Does it?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Yes, and very beautiful.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
So you felt it too!
Give it to me!!!
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
But how do you know?
I know. Let her alone.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
That and more.
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
And they frighten you?
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
You can't look at them...
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
But it has. There is no more to tell.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Some.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Why are you being like this?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
This weekend?
I'm fine.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
It's...him.
Did you get help?
I guess so.
Why?
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Wanna drink?
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
Good winds and bad winds!
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was �- perhaps it was.
Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
I think not.
No one can take my father's place.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
She has never mentioned her family.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
Miss Wollsten!
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints �� the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
No. I mean your other secret -�	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
Really, this is idiotic!
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Why -- no not before Thea came ��
You were at those battles as a spectator � � I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me �� those men out there �� dead or dying �� by my order -- because I willed it so.
Thea?
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle �-
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
The General threatened me.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
Angel, Second Class.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Sit down? What are . . .
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
Not a soul.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting �� to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Hiya, George!
Mother? What do you want?
Today, over at the house.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
I'm all right.
Oh, George!
Yes, sir.
Anything I can do back here?
Don't hurt my ear again!
Okay.  What's yours?
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
Have you notified the police?
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
I don't like coconuts.
Well, why don't you say it?
Ummmmm . . .
Uh-huh.
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
That does it �� come here.
Thanks for dropping around.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Where's your coat and hat?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, George, George!
I want to go faster!
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Is she responsible for the punch?
They're moving pretty fast.
It's not going to be easy.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
I need a hand here....
Aren't you off-duty?
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
If there is, develop it!
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Oh, c'mon.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Me neither.
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Is that what it is?
The whale's mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Because they're playing our song.
Home it is.
As far as the office.
So's a donut.
Damn.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Are you going to be able to sleep?
That's great.
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
I know, I know....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Two of them are still missing!
What for?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
That's what he said.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Hiya yourself.
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
I will, I will.
Help!  Help!
What Kids?  Who went out?
I'm going.
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
What about me?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Hope I make it through both.
See you later.
Honey, I gotta go.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
I don't like what he does.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Take a deep breath and hold it.
No.
They just wanted to say hello.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
I know I can capture it.
No.
... Me, too.
No,  I'm not going through there.
So?
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
I don't understand.
Me.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Yes, aren't we all.
I thought they were clever.
I told you, something's upset them.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Some miss all their shots.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
Sure am.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Take it up.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
What?
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Yes, there is goes.
Hey.
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Right, Mike.
... I'll go to McDonalds.
So was Dad.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
I want to see Kathryn.
Something wrong?
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
We need beer....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Off....
I have work....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
I'm not on vacation....
Henny Youngman....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I'm on the phone....
You're silly....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
I'm fine....
You just got here....
There's nothing to worry about....
Doesn't matter....
Where do I pull off...?
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
The whole idea is preposterous....
Good news travels fast....
We'll be done pretty soon....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Feathers all over the place....
You tagging them...?
I made them, man....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Put me down, damnit....
What?
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
We got it together, Jake....
So did I....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Screw you, Jake....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
Yeah?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
How about any guys on your staff?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
Pay me, and I shut up.
You want me to stop the car?
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Listen to me saying what?
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
You don't really believe this?
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Have you got a match on the bullet?
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
Three or four.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Bullshit.
He ain't offerin me shit.
No.
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Have you known her long?
He said that? What else did he say?
I know.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Yeah, I guess I do.
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Listen to me, it's over.
No.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
We will be fine!
Happy. He said "happy?"
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Oh hell yes.
Easy, easy --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
Please, if I start talking --
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Ten seconds, Rod.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Let's do it again.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Another drink please.
I understand your anxiety.
No, I'm saying to be --
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
No.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Beautiful.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
What DO you stand for???
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
They do, my brother.
I'm not your brother!
Right up ahead, buddy --
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
Can you be quiet?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
No, it's...
Eric!
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it�s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
That one time was just the bumper.
I don't remember
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
I don't think so.
They never got that big.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
KEEP GOING!
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
How do you mean?
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
It doesn't matter what I think.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
I want to see the nesting ground!
I don't even know this woman.
That Richard.
You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
Okay.
You've broken its leg!
Good.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
You're going too?
So that others would know about this place?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
You think this is all a joke?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
Can the kid walk?
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
Oh my God.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
The what?
Not just every six weeks.
- - and swallows fresh ones.
The fences are electrified, right?
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Why not?
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim, are you okay?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Amphibian DNA.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
For a further three years.
Let's get outta here!
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Thanks for the presents.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
I think we're lost.
Help me with this.
What about that other guy?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Fuck you.
Who's chest?
He's fucking nuts.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
Cute waitresses?
I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Yeah, what is it?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Yes -- that's us.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
I'll commit that to memory.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
Tonight?
And you ...?
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
You look tired.
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
What's to become of us now?
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
It's ... lovely.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
You're the animals - all of you!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
What's compassion, mister.
Uh uh.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yes?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Like for you to look for the man.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
I go on rounds.
Is there anything more I could --
Well --
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
Why?
I don't get you.
Mm.
What?
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
You're going back?
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
OK.
I believed her, Pete.
It's got to make sense some way.
Well there's a couple --
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
I wanted to give it to you first.
Goodbye, Pete.
Two years ago? Sorry.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
I know Tom Grunemann.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
What about your mommy?
Playing.
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Greatest...
Show...
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Goodbye.
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
Then eat around it.
No!
Are you...gonna go...away?
See you in the morning light.
I love you...
Uh huh...
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
What don't you understand, pal?
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Such as?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Beautiful.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
I don't know, Jim...
Are you firing me, Jim?
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Any prospects?
No, but--
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
Things? What kind of things?
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Tell me.
Here. We'll collect them.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
I miss him too.
I accept it. What is suffering?
Can India help us?
Where is that?
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
Please, come in, so cold.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
You decide.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
Ahh.
Eliminate you.
How could I ever leave?
It is possible, Holiness.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
Keystone what?
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
I coulda shot you, you--
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
So profound and fat.
I don't know!
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
You talk to Bickerman?
Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Could we have intercourse?
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
Never been to Maine before?
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I didn't say it like that.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Let's get away from the shore.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
We might as well pack.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Take him.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
I just let go of it.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
<u>Kelly</u>--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
I really... I should get back.
He knew her...!
Sometimes.
Get me out!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Thanks.
I think we may be, yes.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
But if he knew we have so little time -
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
I think so.
Sometimes you do.
Maybe they'll catch up.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Reasonably so. Yes.
And the questionnaire...?
Why? Do you know something about him?
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
No.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
All right, then tell me how -
Later, listen, I'll -
What was it?
So you ran away...
But you could. You did.
Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
What?!
Why did they turn back?
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
How did you learn English?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Miss.  May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
There was no letter.
You still have an aversion to the water?
"Some"?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Dark haired...
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
I'm not a doctor.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Can you fix it?
Fuck your orders!
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
I can't see them!
He's not at his station.
...I'd really have to show it to you.
And it killed Bo?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Hook's on 24...
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
I'm going to try to remove it.
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Right.
Hardly.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
It's hit us all hard!
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
I still will, if you don't mind.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
That inspires confidence, that does.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
You had better be careful.
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
And the weed?
Out the back.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
I'll only be a minute.
For half a million?
Yes?
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
You know how much it is, Nick.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
You've already been fifteen.
Tom, you're all heart.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Six.
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
That isn't true.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're dismissed.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
I'm feeling okay--
I'm not picking it up.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
No. You?
Suppose not.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
No sir.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
Same as they done in Mexico.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
So I'm part-Indian?
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
Tanks, huh?
No.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Pleased to meet you.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
That's right.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
And people make their choice--
Because I'm your father.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
We have a daughter.
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
He still living?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
You thought any more about our murder?
Charley Wade.
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
Well, you hire illegals--
If you spent a little more time training them--
I was too busy.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
You ever play one of these?
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
People didn't complain?
Okay? He's not here?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
For a while.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Time marches on.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
So I've heard--
I'll see what's going on.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Amado.
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
They've got me. Different thing.
Nothing.
Yeah.
Pilar--
Yeah?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Yeah.
I'm going over to the other side.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
Why you think that was?
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Knew what?
Isn't that French for something?
That's so cool.
He's a priest?
No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
Death.
Will you come to him on your knees?
He's with us... He's with us...
Why not?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
Where do I sign?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Out!  Out!
You saw this?
I left three messages already.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Mr. D'Amour?
What are you, my mother?
Maybe I just bought it.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
Philip Swann?
What's the difference?
Probably.
Yes.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
Not the Walter Wilder?
I don't know what else to do.
Will that do?  No?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Yes.
Jesus!
Looks that way.
I don't know.
I got to go.  I'm late.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
What is?
Why would I want to?
Ok.
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
I'm here for the week.
It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?
No, its easy.
No, you smiled.
No, I was looking at you.
No, yes, it does...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
Yes.
Ok, bye.
Oh?
Hello, darling.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
What?
When are you coming home?
What?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Sure.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
I don't know.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Hmmm.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Just me.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Something he said, just before...
You killed my parents.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
Trick him.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
He can see you Thursday.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Of course.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
Nothing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Watch your mouth.
I can't eat before a game.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Need any help?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Don't curse.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Okay.
This time get your feet set.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Careful.
Uh-huh.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Mom's going to hate it.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
So how's the job going?
For real?
I don't like flowers.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Guess not.
Whatever, big head.
You do see me standing here, right?
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
She understands.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
Not really.
What the hell's going on?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
I'm not asking for us to be together.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
From basketball.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Then why are you so upset?
Wrong.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
We were just studying.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
You came out early.
Why?
Your door was unlocked.
We need to talk.
What?
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
ooohhhhhh no.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
What's wrong?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Sure is.  So why call me?
I don't wanna talk to you.
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
baby, please, please --
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm sorry.
You don't have a boyfriend?
Yeah.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Okey-doke.
I'm sorry.
Good bye.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Really?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
So you've done it --
It's fine.
just let me walk out, ok?
Yes.
Claudia What?
Not enough, what do you want?
DAD.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
I'm a rapper.
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
I was listening --
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
This sounds threatening.
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Shall we drink to that?
You see?
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
When was the last time you talked to your son?
Go fuck myself?
Yep.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
Are you asking me that?
She does.  From when you were a boy.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
She's my mother.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
I wouldn'tve asked --
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
They wouldn't?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Is he in pain?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
You're just come in --
I AM CALM.
I live alone.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
No.
No.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
All your other fluzzies?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I won't.
Fuck no.
I'm sorry.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
No.  No.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Was there anyone that I know?
Paula.  Ellen.
No one else that I know?
Do you have any children with anyone?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Hi.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
Love you too.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
....Why does he do it...?
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Replace the king.
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
But --
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
He lures us to capture.
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Die?  What...?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I heard your playing.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
D'Artagnan...
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
It shall be done, your Majesty.
He is my brother.
... The ball... Continue.
I must insist, Sire.
Eh?
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
Yes, yes, go on.
We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Every step of the way.
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Yeah...
What?
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Who is it?
Where up north?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Found what?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Not the Bible?
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
I have to.
Why not?
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You said the guy down here is good.
Why?
See? You do know something about him.
We will feel sick for a very long time.
Get me a plane!
When I'm done.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
How do I know?!
It's not over yet.
He had to.
Don't talk to me!!
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Tonic will be fine.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
I'll get my purse.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
I don't know...
Yes.
No.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
If I were?
At the store. You doin' some good?
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
Then why?
Is Crawford going with you?
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
What's the problem, Molly?
Will?  You could come up here.
Tell her I called.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
I hope you have a second chance...
You got it.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
I refuse.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
That's alright.  Where...?
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
You're NOT DYING!
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
What is this, World War Two...?
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Goals are important.
Yes, your Holiness?
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Yes.
I know.  It's her fault.
I know but I felt like taking a shift.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.
Sorry.
Really?
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
They'll be able to track it.
Go the the Adams Street bridge.
For what?
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
Because... I didn't think I would?
How?
She would say she knows enough.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
That's why we're here.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Who are you?
My name is Trinity.
That was a long time ago.
What?
I just thought... you were a guy.
They're watching you, Neo.
What is the Matrix?
From you.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
Are you worried?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Duck!
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Got it.
Follow me.
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Anybody wanna have a game?
She don't look Jewish.
Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Panther!  Same thing...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Ok, how's everything going?
Ok...that's it.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
$20.
How much was the original loan again?
Whatever.
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
What did he do?
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
I don't mind.
It's all right.
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Sure.
Thanks.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
It's for the party, Dad --
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
Both.
Hi.
Drew, you're out of line.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Here...
Of whom?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
The dagger --?
What?!
That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
What are their feelings?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
You loved back?
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Hey, this is fun.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
I didn't know that.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Love.
What do you mean 'free'?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I don't have any.
I appreciate you --
I am, too.
'To bed'?
Why, yes.  Thank you.
How beautiful.
I loved it.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
Don't.  That will come later.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
Not at all.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Of course.
Yes, Bill.
Not this.
I'm not everybody.
What's it like where I'm going?
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Why didn't you stop me?
This universe?
I told you, 'watch it'.
You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Are you threatening me?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
You like him, don't you?
I am.  With you.
Uh oh --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Yer damn right.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
I don't know.
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
That's why it's okay.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I'm sorry --
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
Y'didn't?
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Seen you together, that's all.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
What the fuck are you doing here?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
You did explain, Lenny.
You told me.
Tell me about her again.
It's isolated.
So I just take your word?
Where is he?
What does he want?
Can I ask you something?
Thanks.
What are you here for?
Thank you.
It's good.
Shut your mouth!
Mr Gammell?
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
What's wrong with this one?
Who's she?
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
How do you know this?
How do you know him?
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
Are you sure?
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
No. You took them out.						  *
Your name's Teddy.
Why would I have a gun?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
It's a rip and a hit.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
I got the item.
Two main players plus three.
Make it 35.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
She's dead...
Available cash is not an issue for us...
Twenty-eight-point-five.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
I'll be there.
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Stevens?
Chill out Sonny.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
Do we need this...?
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Same all around! For my friend, too!
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Whatsa matter now?
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Gin's okay.
What?
You want me to leave?
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
... and taxi fare for me.
Is he all right!
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Don't make me laugh.
Shit.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Yes...?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
But just...
What's your father do?
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
It's not fair!
Aslan, there... 
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Yeah.
After we're outside the kogus?
That's a great philosophy.
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Just do it!
I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
You know what I mean...
Maybe they lied to you.
That's camouflage...
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
What-
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
I can.  We can do this...
Oh, Jesus.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
Sounds good.
--my number one fan.
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Yeah, thanks.
Well, I hope you like it.
I DIDN'T...
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
To Misery.
It is.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Just from his agent.
What thing?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
So do I...
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
I suppose I did.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
'Thief in the Night?'
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
More like two-two point two million.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
He's heading down the stairs, now..
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
No.  Should I?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Indeed.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
I've no doubt.
I'll muddle through.
Not necessarily.
'Terrorists?'
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
Okay!
But why tell us?
What kind of show.
Krieger.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Of course - I�m sorry to hear you say that Claire.
It�s all right, Ethan..you�ll bring me back...won�t you...
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Yes.
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Why, may I ask?
Why should I?
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
Higher.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
I guess.
Sure.  If the main character does.
They�re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
I usually am.
They stamped it, didn�t they?  Those damn Gideons.
I don't know.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Connection denied.
It�s not working.
Rita. Pass the wine.
What?
I'm going to bed now.
I don't know what you mean.
What killed him?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Hurry up.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Yes.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
Stupid.
How many men since then?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Because I have no Luck!
I was dead.
I've got you.
You don't get along with anybody!
Kinda gaudy.
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
Yeah.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
That's right.
I'm really afraid.
I'm afraid of who I am.
I was.
Johnny.
Never is a long time.
Will you marry me?
On the floor?
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
He's my younger brother.
We should talk alone.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Why not?
Where you been?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
A wife knows.
No more he's not.
What's the matter with him?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
I... a... slept with my fianc�'s brother.
Talk to him.
Where is she?
I don't know.
You don't know where Loretta is?
No idea.
Okay, I'll tell her.
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
Don't shit where you eat.
Go ahead.
Yes.
I guess you can't invite me in?
Well. That explains it.
What? What?
Oh.
Cosmo.
What would he be doing down there?
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
King of the WHO?
What?
NI!
What is that?
You said it again!
Then you shall die.
'Tis but a scratch.
Had enough ... ?
You're a looney.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
You know my name?
A G...g...g...
Who did we lose?
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Bloody peasant! 
The nose?
I feel happy... I feel happy.
To find the Holy Grail.
Blue.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
I think I could pull through, sir.
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Well ... I'll tell you ...
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Is that clear?
Oh, I see,  Right.
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
Camelot ...
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
Shut up.
Not bad, not bad.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
She'll be worried about me.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
It's a diary.
What do you take me for?
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I see.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
It is quite late enough.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
By whose authority?
My own.
Aye, do.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
This is a slur on her good name.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
I am a blank sheet.
If you hunt, you kill.
It's nothing.
Oh.
See what?
Aye, ma'am.
I'm glad of it.
Archie.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Yes.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Yes, ma'am.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Because I have to! 
Oh, several things.
No, ma'am.
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
Dear oh dear.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
The same, your Majesty.
Unwell?
Has he been hurt?
No.  I shall be out walking.
He is sick, ma'am.
Yeah, who isn't.
Maybe he's not dead.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
I came from the city on the left.
It is.
So how did it know my name, then?
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
The Police, then...
And beat it at it's own game.
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
What are you going to do?
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
I know.  It sucks.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
There never is.
And then keep on driving?
I'm thinking!
The game will guide you.
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
Give her a chance, will you?
Who fired everyone?
No.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
You gotta be kidding?
Yeah.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Well, I ...
I told ya.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
But you won't.
Diane?
But it said #12.
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
Good luck!
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Okay.
But I want to.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
I just wanted to come here.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
Go ahead.
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Find out who they are?
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
I'm working on it.
I'm leaving.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Fine...
That was eleven years ago.
Hey , Hey !
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
That's cute asshole.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Don't eat at the console.
But, he's...
When will that be ?
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
Sir ?
That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Aren't you the bitter one.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Do you want to go out with me ?
Yes.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Zach from work ?
We made it !
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
You're Vada right?
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Okay thanks, atta girl.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Was it a nice funeral?
Of course.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I will. How's Shelly?
Can I see him?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
How about a nice glass of milk?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
You're being narrow-minded.
I'd like to, thanks.
Special effects?
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
oh.
I know that.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
I'm sure she did. 
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
I'd never do that.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
They're great.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
Yes, it does.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
A secret, I like that.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
I'll be here.
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
Oh, sure okay.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Oh no.
Hey! Oh look.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
This guy bonking you?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
It's there.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
This is where we are.
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
Really?
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Did you ahh, love him?
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
You never cared before.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
Get away, get away!!
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Do you miss her?
Bye.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Can we look around in your camper?
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Uh huh.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
What's wrong with your eyes?
What?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Heaven.
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
What?
Bye Ma.
He likes her better than me.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Not true.
Uh huh.
I honestly wish I could...
Part of being a New Yorker.
The wandering sportswriter.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
You've been working on this, huh?
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
What do you suggest?
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
No.
He won't get mad, huh?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
Nobody has.  So far.
W...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
You never eat when you're despondent.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
If you like.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
Get married, apparently.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
That is so romantic.
... and you knew about this.
What is that sup...
MICHAEL!!
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
You're much more his type.
Well, that just happened that time.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
What?
I won first prize.
Then why are you listening to her -
What?
What did you say your name was?
I got them right here.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
He knows better.
Your job, huh.
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
That's what he wants.
Sure thing.
When is it?
How come?
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
What is a turkey shoot.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Sure he will.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
I don't really know what you're talking about.
I don't know his first name.
When did you start singing?
When I was little, in church.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Linnea?
I'm not sure. Where?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Doesn't it have a name?
I knew when I first met you.
Well...
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
For him?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Where are you going?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
What?
He ain't really new.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Is that good?
You serious?
More or less...
Yes you are.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
Yes, you are.
What did you think then?
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
Ain't love grand.
What?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yours.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory.
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Out front.
On average forty million.
Got it.
So, what now?
No fuckin' way!
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Jesus...
I hear ya. Play.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Two-thirty. Shhh...
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Tomorrow.
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Ya know, I was.
What are we talking about?
They done that too long in my family.
No thanks.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
No. You got the wrong idea.
What did you say your name is?
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Guess I don't.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
I don't know.
Yeah, I been there.
No. I'm new in town.
I like a place with lots of life.
Scared, huh?
Good night, Duff.
Why did you?
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
What?
Don't push me, Duff.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
I don't want to hurt you.
Yeah.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
There's nothing to say.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
What's so hot 'round town?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Yeah, see you in hell.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Okay.
How are you?
It ain't in me.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
I understand.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Right here.
Omar, listen to me--
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
What does this have to do with me?
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Can you read my mind?
The words?
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
I don't have a girl.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
I had to limit your options.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
A regular Fagan.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Yeah.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
What went down between you and Riviera?
I know you have. C'mere.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Why do they listen to Guy?
Petty good.
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy�  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
You need my help?
Transitioned?
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
I'm Rob's prom date.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Good.
Better than I...
You're twenty-three years old!
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Well, are you here with anybody?
You were attracted to me?
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Why?
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Where?
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Only the wet ones.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
It's happening again.
How come?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Wow...
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
Make a left at this corner.
Whoa!
Oh, Jesse...
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
Making friends?
I'm sure you would.
He's full of shit.
I had such an awful dream.
Can't it wait till morning?
Don't hold your breath.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
I gotta stay up, Max.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Thank you.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Call me Nancy.
Sorry.
Sounds like a rough time.
I'm serious.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
Try me.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Your dreams?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
This is stupid.
I forgot my bag.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Why?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
You've got to go.
Come in.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Eleven.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
You have a stunt bottom?
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
What?
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Who was Gilda?
Undressed like this, yes.
How do you think I'm doing?
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
What's your name?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
This is Henry James film?
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Definitely no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
She's perfect, perfect.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Right.  No one else?
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Yes.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Right.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Yes, that is correct.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Yeah?
No way.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Hearts.
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
What? Where?
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Atta boy, Cheswick!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Right, Mack!
What?
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Me, too...
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Did to me?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
You heard me the first time!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Me. Hit me!
A nickel.
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
I see...
You bet, Doc!
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
Time out!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
What?
Hi.
Potential assaultive.
Boogered!
On what?
I don't have any.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Thank you, ma'am,
Why, sure, ma'am...
Is he one of the loonies?
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Of course not.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
Because.
Yes.
Ha un numero di telefono?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
My picture's up?
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who's this?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
My name's 
If it's any of your business, yes.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Right now?
Hi.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Nice dress.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
GET OUT!!
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
What would you call it?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Yes.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Tonight?
And more...
Oh.
So, what's your point?
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
I don't know, Kate.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
I have vacation time coming to me.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Live happily ever after.
You're coming with me?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
So?
A phone message.  Only--
'Course he does.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Polo.
Oh my God.  Where?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
I meant about my idea.
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
Kate.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Giovanni.
Huh?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
Thanks.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth�
Well, where are they?
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
That was the idea.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Mm�hmmm.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against� 
I know. I know.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
I really don't know.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Go ahead, wear it.
I know... I know... .
I've been sittin' in the church.
You?
Edie� it's�
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
Edie...
He's going to have to grow up too.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
What are you going to do?
Good luck.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but�
What do you think?
So help me God!
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies� I'm on borried time.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Looking for me?
No?
Hey look-
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
OK� skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
I am--It's our only chance.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Maybe so.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
What kind of symbol?
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Live ones where only the dead should be?
You know better than that.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
I said not as a rule.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Just that she got away.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Shit.
Now you're talkin'.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
You might not have a choice.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
They sure do.
And then they'll kill 'em.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
It was an unusual experience.
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Excuse me, Adele?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
I thought everything.
Hey.  You learn from doing.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
None of your business.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
That's my dad.
You won't do that.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Don't leave me.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
A girl.
It smelled.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Why not?
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
So she did help you?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Really?
I know what you're talking about.
It's a big house.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
What's to think about?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
You're not?
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
I <i>was</i>...
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
What do you want?
No.
Got run over by a car.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
He's about to.
No?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
I didn't have time.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
That's right, just me.
I don't have any idea.
Well, I need that...
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
That's me, Sir.
You liked that?
Sir, I --
What the hell happened to you guys?
You guys are new?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Yeah.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Thank you, Sir.
Well sure, Colonel --
Boxin'.
What do you get for winning?
Nice to meet you, Betty.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Refresh my memory.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
They'll learn to live with it.
Thanks.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Charlie, how are you?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
You really love me, don't you?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
What am I going to do with you?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
But what has to be different?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
I'm trying.
What about Janet?
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
For everyone.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Thank God for that.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
What's inside?
I don't know.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life�styles.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
Sure.
All set.
He pissed me off.
I'm not burying him here...
There's a better place...
What did?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
In a word, Bob...
Drew!
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Close the law book.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
We're waiting...
Sounds delightful.
Funny.
I have AIDS.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
No. They didn't fire her.
Correct.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
I've considered that.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Thank you.
Sure thing.
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Yes.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Absolutely.
No. I can't really see it.
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Right.
It satisfied me.
In a word, yes.
What kind of people?
Great.
Aren't you?
You're the asshole, buddy.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Beckett?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Helloooo...
Dr. J.!
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
What whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Get out of our way.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
25 kilos each, huh?
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Let's wait on the power cells.
<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
What, you're goin' off, too?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
I'm born-again.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Well, what's it look like now?
Just realized that, huh?
Nice embellishment.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Shut up.
You didn't think so then.
Yo!
But how long is a day?
Him.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Show this to the President.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
He's trying to form words.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
To Earth! That we've landed!
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
I'm for that.
What?
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
To scare off humans?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Shhhh!
Maybe not.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor, you can't.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
God bless you.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Like you, I find it difficult.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Yeah, what is it?
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
No!
Jes' fine man, jes fine! Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out.  See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir... 
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
...beautiful night.
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
You know what I'm talking about!
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias! 
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
He dugged his own grave.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Right...
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I'm sure you have.
Would you mind?
Bank?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
And do you amuse the guests?
He got in here how?
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Dance? Here?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Try not talking.
You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
They're going to arrest me.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
You leave it.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
No.  I paid him off.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Right, Miss.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
That's an evasion and you know it.
There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
You must come from pretty far South.
We wouldn't have met at all.
I don't want to talk.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Points very straight to her.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
I know that.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
For five hundred, what do I get?
A thousand.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
So you're not a cop.
Hardly. Who's the girl?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
We do, when we get the chance.
I never notice the view after the first week.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
The only answer I have for you.
It could have been an accident.
No idea.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Let me know when you've identified him
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Now, you're being beastly.
I'll take your word.
Brandon handled the money envelope.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
Aye.  You have a point there.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
But you still think she's innocent.
What are my orders, sir?
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Why should I mind?
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
In an hour, Larry.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Are you going to have coffee?
I thought it was tremendous.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Oh yes?
Both dead.
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
You just might.
I haven't really thought about it.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
I'm not sure.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Not at all.  History.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
Zero distortion, sir.
Not so far.
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
You're kneeling on my hand.
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
No more games.
We're going to need everyone.
You know you can't win this one.
I'll take him.
Thank you, Sergeant.
The best friend I ever had.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Hope to be?
I talked to some developers about the land.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
No.
New York.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
You know how to drive a stick?
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Uh-huh.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Occupational hazard?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Vivian --
All right, two thousand.
Three.
I got a dress, yeah.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
Was someone rude to you?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
I really am sorry.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
It was good.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Afternoon.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
We just did.
You're being ridiculous.
I'm up.
Why?
Give me twenty minutes.
Let him answer.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
All this because of that whore!
Who did you think?
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Rent.  You're late.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Kit give me nothin'.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Professionally?
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm just looking, thanks.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
Of course you will.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Who's Guilder?
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Anybody want a peanut?
I thought I was going faster.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
-- what? --
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Over the Albino, I think.
I'll be right back.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
DEATH FIRST!!
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
I thought he was with you.
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Are you a rotten liar.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
Thank you.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Tell me.
You know what a hurry we're in.
You've made your decision then7
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Yeah, an hour.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Well, sir, it seems ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Two pistachios, my good man.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
What is she gonna do here?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Vat about it?
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Come on.  Let's get going.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
By the sacred memory...
Heil you know who!
Vat?
Where are you going vit the light?
Send for Goebbels.
We won.
Groovy!
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Oh.
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
Tell me all about her.
How early?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Someone is sitting in that window.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Can I trade in my car and take another?
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Of course not. Please.
Five hundred.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
And the police haven't been able to...
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I ought to call the police right now!
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Well?
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
You're not.
This is the old highway.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Bates never denied Mary was here.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
No.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You have a vacancy?
The bathroom.
I imagine so.
Is your time so empty?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
I'd like to, but...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Norman took a wife?
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Do what?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Shut up! Shut up!
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Why didn't you notify the police?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
There's no child here.
No?
Joseph returns from the room where Gis�le is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Thank you.
It happens that I'm the law.
You mean he was colored?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
What does that prove?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Thanks.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
You weren't going with her?
Darned if I don't! 
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Good night, sir.
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
I could go out of town.
Where to?
A place you've never been.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Like now?
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Well, I got to see her.
Where is she?
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Well, some fiend might.
But Rose...
You're my sweetheart.
What was your mother like?
I do, too.
All right, what do you know?
Well, yeah.
Daddy, what's the matter?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
She's watching the car again?
What are they doing?
Then why does she act so dumb?
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Please do.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
Who?
I... I'll get the grits.
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Got yourself up?
There are more on the other side.
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
Yes, sir.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Nothing, Rose.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Afraid of the hospital?
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
You can stop it right now.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
You're so sweet.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
It'll get better now.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
But... I love him.  I do...
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Now you know what to watch for...
Who cares?
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
That wasn't my fault.
Get ready.
Move it!
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Yeah.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
What day is it?
Feeling great.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's go time, Billy-B.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
No, we're stealing.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
You going rogue on me?
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Can't I?
I... I think I can... clarify...
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
That's not true.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Beholden to none.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
Yeah.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
Yoda spoke of another.
Jabba's palace.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
We got separated.
Yeah, sure.
I gotta get you out of here.
It'll work. It'll work.
Here's the terminal.
I'm trying!
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Proper?!
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Red Leader standing by.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
I will not fight you, father.
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
Yes or no will do.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
I told you, my car broke down.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Yes.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
It's alright Janet.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Makes you cry
From Transexual Transylvania.
Free to try and find a game
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
...I'm sorry.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
I'll call your brother.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
...What?
I'll be waiting.
Yes.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
Yeah...
What did you say about a pet shop?
...I can't beat him.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
I'll carry him 'till the third.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
Get that doctor.
You're hurtin', man!
...It's very American.
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Don't like yours neither.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Charge it.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
A few bucks.
Mr. Balboa --
I'm sure you are.
Did you hear what I said?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What?
Makes your breath like garbage.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
I said, how ya feelin'?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
...Did ya fight last night?
Ain't they?
Think about it.
Message -- What message?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
How do you mean?
Yeah.
Freak luck is a strange thing.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Check the eyes, Ben.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Fine... That guy's great.
...Yeah.
Great, kid, great.
It ain't your locker no more.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Yo, Paulie.
What?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
Ice skate.
I got whiskey here.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
The story -- what's happenin'?
Sure I like her.
What gaps?
To see ya train.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
R.K. Maroon.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Where is he?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
I've already seen your photographs.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
No, it's not.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
By my heel, I care not.
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Welcome.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
A most courteous exposition.
Right.
NO! Mercutio!
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Of course.
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
And who are you?
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
You sure about this?
Shut up!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
What's a little hate between business partners?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Now that is an interesting proposition.
It's done.
Nobody's going to do that!
Really?
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
How did you know?
But first you have something to take care of?
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Coordinate what?
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Gregor's cell phone...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
A lot of people died.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
Thorough man.
So I do it.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
You speak French.
Nothing...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
Gone.  Destroyed.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Hell, it won't be us!
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
He saw everything!
That's not what I mean.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I don't know...
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Do you have everything?
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Uh huh.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
HELLLLLP!!!!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
You mean that guy was an agent?
Denning was wearing a bug.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
What for?
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Are you sure you're OK?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
He's not, he's...
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Yeah.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
I have a better plan.
We appreciate that.
Dwayne.
No I don't.  You sure you haven�t seen her?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
All right you�re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Well I'm here now.
I don't know...
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Calm down --
Oh Jesus Christ...
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Absolutely positively.
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
The band has been playing over an hour.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
Lee, you okay?
You bring American money?
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
I'm sorry.
How you doin'?
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
You.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Forget it.
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
How do you know he's our man?
You sound like that all the time.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
What?
Take it!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
See you in the next world.
Fine.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
I'll give it my best shot.
Just GO!
You take care of yourself, Lee.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
First class.
Some Kung-Pao?
Just trying to make it look real.
Any leads?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
I'll take him.
The police can protect you.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
I know, but --
Carter.
No.
I was being polite.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Right....
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
I'm sorry.
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
The Feds?!
They put you in charge?
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
I do.
I was trying to find the right time.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
What did he ask?
It happens to be how I feel.
Of course.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
All the gory details.
Then you'll be my best man.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
Thank you.
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Without oxygen...
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
So?  Is that what you said to her?
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
You don't know.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
You humiliated me!
I already explained about that.
Lost!
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I'd rather not.
A little longer for me.
This is getting serious.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Why?
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
But I'm weird.
It's for the bell.
Quick.  Very quick.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
Yeah.
Nope.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
They're going to love you.
Even when you were young?
Happy New Year.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Okay, okay.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
You couldn't.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
I told you.  Nothing --
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
Actually, he sounded nice.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Magic.
Mom, we already...
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
What's tira misu?
Eighty dollars.
What is it?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I don't know.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Well...
You're kidding --
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
They are singing for me.
With Ram�n it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
Got to talk to the brothers.
What's more important than sanitation?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
I've had them since the day they were born.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Hunting.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Will you be still?
No ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
You've got to help around the house!
You should have helped her without being asked.
What can I do for you?
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 

No, Why?
Who wouldn't?
Now that's down-right insulting.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
I can't.
I can't leave.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
How?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Therapy session is over.
It's me.
Ass first into the world.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
How?
Finland is a country.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
No. I'm good.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
And you want me to do you some big favor?
What does that mean?
No, I'm good.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Big Bill.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Yeah, dickhead.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
The Mexicali Boys
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Really?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Why are you doing this?
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Spit it out, Captain.
I guess.
What deal?
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
My guess, too.
Some.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Goddamn it, sir...
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Fresh out.
Is it getting worse?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
And what about your own hand?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
There's always a bright side.
Why's that?
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
Twenty-four-five.
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
No, no he's not.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Gee, it's easy.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
Lloyd.
Please?
That's just so embarrassing.
Yes.
See you tomorrow.
Alright.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I love you dad.
I won?
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
What am I supposed to think?
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
You will?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Goodbye.
Would you hold this for me?
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
That's cool then.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
Be friends?
Right.
Am I wrecking my car?
No.
You're shaking.
Your letter came yesterday.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
We decided...
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
No.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
I'm sorry.
You do?
Okay.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Hello Lloyd.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Your car?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
What?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
I called her up.
You know Diane Court?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I don't know.
Alright!
Now you're back.
I'm talking to a clerk.
Oskar, please -
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
Good.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
What's going on?
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
I don't know.  Soon.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
That's great.
Things are great, things are great.
Something they can hold in their hands.
Christmas presents.
Oskar -
What other point is -
We're aware of that.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
I'm losing you.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
That's too bad.
I'm inquisitive.
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
And much richer as a result.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Finish what my son started.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
You freakin?
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
What guy?
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
You�d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It�s a whole world, Sid. You�re really popular amongst the demented.
We�re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And we didn�t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money�s worth.
Tails.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
Yeah, right.
I'll give you one guess.
You're getting obvious.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
My morn was a Delta.
The safety what? Fuck that!
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
I counted four.
Easy black boy.
But she's standing right next to you.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Where you going?
Don't panic.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Melinda McGraw?
Who is this?
Thanks.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
And who would that be?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Did you request this case?
Yeah. A real tragedy.
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
What?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Sure.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
GALE WATCHOUT!
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
No.
W-what do you want?
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
WHERE?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
And if you get it right -- you die.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Yeah... I think so.
I called my dad.
So why did you dial it again?
Uh-huh.
You never told me your name.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I can't think.
Then answer the question. Same category.
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
He's not a suspect, is he?
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
I like it. It's... sexy.
I'll get my camera.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
How is she?
Yes, sir, sheriff.
I told you to send it back.
You want to go live?
What's the delay?
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
What am I doing?
I heard screaming.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
And what would be your motive?
I can cry on cue.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
How do you gut someone?
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's past seven.
I'm not worried.
And you believe it?
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Tits -- see.
Thank you.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
We would have gotten you eventually.
There's a bucket.  Under the table.
Can we talk about this in private?
Tonight.
What about them?
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
I know.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
It's got to be.
Just wait!
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Him?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
It was him.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
What are you talking about?  What happened?
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
Huh...? No...no water.
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Now mount up, son...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Ain't yours yet.
Leggo...
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
What?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
We got two around that age...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
I mean the armchair!
I'll do it myself.
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Someone from the village.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
In the village.  Look what I found.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
You have the last act?
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Most interesting.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Yes, I saw it.
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
it will be all right, madam.
Who wrote that?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To my weekly confession.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
Go on.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
Wonderful, wonderful.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Romeo is�Italian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
I am not so well-born.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
"Madam!"
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow�"
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Ay me."
I like her.
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
A lowly player.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
That's my line!
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?�she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke�Orsino.
Nor you for me.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
Lady Viola is�young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
Does she say so?
Your aunt?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
That dog!
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
In the same fashion as chess.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Come on, David.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
He couldn't get his car started.
You call them if you want.
So who's going to do it?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
Just stop worrying.
You think so?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
There was a break-in.
What's wrong?
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
This is just an informal discussion.
What does it look like?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
I see.
Yes, thanks.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Cameron?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
-- instead of what he is --
Did what?
Unfeasible.
I don't want to. It's different.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Who was it?
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
That's what I thought he said.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Yeah.
Of course.
You're sure of that.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds.
No one.
With a face like this?
And you need your sleep.
I'm not sure --
Yes, sir.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
That one, last week.
No.
For what?
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Chicken salad, Devra!
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Why?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
That's okay too.
Yeah, I think so.
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
What kind of treatment?
You're looking great, baby.
I don't know. Just a minute...
I hope she's all right.
Hello, George.
She what?
Nobody can hear it.
No.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Hungry?
No thanks.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
You are.
I went to school with her husband.
It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Yes, Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Probably the bathroom.
Yeah... I mean great.
Whew.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Did Lester know about him?
Hey, I don't tell.
You're a genius.
Don't, don't, don't...
What are you talking about?
You don't do that anymore, do you?
Fuckin' A --
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
We're friends.
-- do you want ice?
What?
-- Right after I sprayed her?
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
I just... who what?
What?
Why am I great?
-- Sure.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Could I talk to you for a second?
Go where?
Egypt!
Going where?
I want your feelings about it.
Right now?
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
-- well aren't you --
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well that's something.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
I'm very tired, George.
I'd like you to leave now.
Baby, don't do this --
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Did you?
Did you?
But Mr. Norman said --
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
Well, yeah.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Isn't that bad for it?
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
I wanna hear it from you!
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
What about Jackie?
No --
I'm finished with her.
I'll call you back.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
Somebody's mother.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
George is going to open a shop.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Don't be silly.
It's been so long I don't how long?
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Sure.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
-- oh I don't know --
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
What?
Try to think what it was.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Room 237?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Who?
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
I hope it's nothing serious.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Hmm, nice.
Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
Yes.
Which room was it?
Good.
I just want to go back to my room.
Stop swinging the bat.
Wendy...
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Oh!
Yes.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
Jesus.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
Went shopping. Why?
What?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Good.
A tracer. You'll like it.
What the hell does that matter?
I told you!
No.
Oh?
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
You know, I just might!
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You know what we're saying!
Were you tempted?
And I'm tearful!
Probation?
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
You pig!
Yes?
HE'S SO FINE.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Why?
Just about.  Show me again.
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
I know.  It's ancient.
Pay attention...
Were you wicked?
Tell me about it.
Three years.  Sister.
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
We're nuns!
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Bless you.
Your cigarette -- out.
You mean black people?
What's a concubine?
Check your driver's license.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
What's wrong with my life?
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
What do you mean?
The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
You have a phone call.
Good day.
Oh?
You saved my life.
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
Maybe Hawaii.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
I am?
Really?  Lieutenant?
How?
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Yeah, like what?
Oh-huh.
I'm telling you!
Which one?
Neither did you!
We're losing it.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
How did you hear this?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
Bring him.
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Your superiors are two days away!
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Master Hardenbrook...
Believe?
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
Father said witches live there.
Witches do not exist.  However...
I hear nothing.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Stay back.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
I doubt that's the end.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
You are funny.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
I insist that you have it.
They have done nothing of the sort.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
Yes, actually.
Use caution.
Let her go!
I can show exactly.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
You are from the Hollow?
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Yeah, me too.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
Give me the big'uns.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
He does make some funny noises.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Would y'all like that?
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
He ain't no count.
Why not? It died?
Yeah.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Yessir.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Okay.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Did Vaughan go home?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I ain't got no boy.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Naw.
Yes sir.
I'll be dog.
Yes ma'am.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
I believe you. I really do.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Okay.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
I'm sorry.
No thank you.
Signs?
I didn't mean that.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
American literature. What else?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
The Queen of England?
What do you mean?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Eighteen and a half years.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
It's all yours, baby.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
Sure thing. See you later.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What difference does it make?
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
And his parents?
I shouldn't have let him go.
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
Just passing through.
It'll cost you five bucks.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Well what?
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Appreciation for what?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
The end.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
No wonder he was angry.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Lettuce and tomato?
They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Is that your third question?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
It seems human.  To me.
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Why?  We're only talking.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
The Japs did it.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Such as?
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
It's private.  Go away.
Those two musicians from the garage!
You're right, Joe.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
Polish?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Then pull the emergency brake!
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
Me?  After Sugar?
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
I am.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
I'm Sugar Cane.
Good night, honey.
Half-full.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Thank you, Daphne.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
Vanity Fair?
Come on, Daphne.
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Oh - here and there - and around.
The Florida job?
I am Cinderella the Second.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Bull fiddle.
Wanna bet?
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
Sorry.
Come one!
We can have it altered.
Why not?
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
And I can never have children.
Well - nobody's perfect.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
Because I got some plans -
Yes, Joe.
My car?  Why, you -
No - funerals.
Better keep a lookout.
Rough?
I'll say.
Bingo?
That so?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Just my feminine intuition.
I don't think so.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
For your own amusement?
You collect shells?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What is it?
It's the crews' night off.
I don't want to bore you.
What else is there for me? 
Is it that hopeless?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
So inhale!
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
You're not?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Why wouldn't I?
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
Drunk isn�t the same thing as happy, Amy.
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Jeffrey told her last night.
I�m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven�t made up since.
There�s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Oh, shut up. You�re an optician.
And you do now?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
Kat, stop it. You do. You can�t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
So, what�s your point?
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
I don�t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Love.
I don�t know.
It�s okay. Hell, I�ve never paid for it. But please don�t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
I�m desperate to start but I don�t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can�t get enough of.
It�s cute.
I do?
A weekend?
First of all, it�s never out of the blue. And second of all--
What?!
I disappear. It�s not about me.
So, why�d you say yes to me?
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you�ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.
Sure. You�ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you�re easy.
Therapist.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You�re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Meet Nick.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
You don't live around here, do you?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Sure--
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Here, put my jacket over you.
Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Hi, Daddy...
I think so...
When's that?
Sunday...
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Same as we -- they pray.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Maybe soon--
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Tired.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Fragile?
Eric!
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
What Cartman?!
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
AGAGAH!!
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Oh.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Yeah, I guess.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
You bastards!!
I don't know, dude.
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
I thought you had something planned.
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
The F word?!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
You bet, Terrance!
Terrance! NO!
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
They're not going to make it!
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
I'm sure I will.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
It's a little late for you to be up.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Thank you.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
10-4 good buddy.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
I don't know.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Seen one like it before?
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Yeah?
Words to live by.
But how are you going to escape?
No, just enjoying the view.
That is one of my priorities.
He's in the bathroom.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Talk to him...Jesus...
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
You have orange whips?
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Lemme see your ball.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
I hate fuckin' opera.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
You wish!
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
He says that to all his wives.
What about bowling?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? 
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
What ever happened to just bowling?
Why would you help me?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
I'm a bowler.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Kinda tough on the butt.
What does he do?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
Plan B is your dad.
He said he'd sponsor me.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Come on, bargain with me.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
It's Junior, isn't it.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
I am a professional man.
I'm not here to bowl.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Your time is up, busyboy.
Please, Dr. Levine.
What is it?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Then why am I here?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
-- Wait a second --
What team?
It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Working on it now, sir.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Sir, about leaving --
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Good theory, Ted.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
Beth --
Beth.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
He what?
The refridgerator.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
What?
Squids?
But how?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
It's a soporific.
Causes sleep.
Doesn't say.
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
How's that?
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
What?
Yes you are...
Where's it coming from?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Fine.  I'm fine.
You sound defensive.
Whatever I can do to help.
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Gimme another explanation.
Page 87 of what, Harry?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Harry?
Her suit's gone.
Wisconsin?
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
I heard!  I heard!
Shut up and catch.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Arrived?  From where?
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Captain who?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
You mean a picture?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Squint harder.
They never used to send a Navy car.
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
I'm beginning not to like you.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
It could be worse...
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Are you safe?
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Death to all bugs !
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
It's all I think about anymore.
Good luck at the academy.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
You two have so much in common.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
Should I be ?
What happened to your eye ?
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
You saying you didn't ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
Well, excuse me, sir...
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Oh, is that how it is ?
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Give'em hell, sir !
The information will not be disclosed.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
You are what...?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
Yes.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Ten seconds....
I want him here.  Sit down!
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
You bet your life.
Who?
Well, it had sentimental value.
"Anguish."
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
Yes...
As the Old Mill goes around...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
...I always thought so...
Yes...
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Me?
Yes.
"Room Service!"
One moment.
You going to ask me in?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
What's the scene...
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
I told them what you said about the script...
Is it...
You know what else a man can do?
Yeah, you?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Drama Group?
That's right...
Yes, that's right.
Ten thousand dollars.
Who is this person that you've found?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Hi.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
That Could Be.
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
What'll I do for fun?
I loved it...he...

No, you're absolutely r...

I'm ready!
Izzat so?
Get him on the...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
But we...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
I'll put the, in your r...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Why not?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
He should be put in jail.
What?
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I...
I...?
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I can only write on a manual.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
What did you say to them...?
I don't know.
I don't...
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
They're coming Fedex...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
Find the money.
Is he cool or angry?
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Ain't no second chances in life.
That will never happen.
I live.  In the same country.
Because it feels really incredibly good.
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
Like a big sister.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
This is a joke, right?
I'll miss you so much.
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
No.  I think it's ugly.
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
But Rache...
That's my girl...
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You say that like I don't know that.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
I'm here.
We're not discussing your age.
Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Yet another spaghetti night.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
She was angry at herself.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
You're a cross-dresser.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
And you said...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
You're the hip and fresh.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
We have to talk.
So I'll have to order in?
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
But?  But what?
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
Rache, get out of th...
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
Really? How many?
Four brothers and five sisters.
My grandchild-baby.
Oh. How did it happen?
How did they execute him?
Why was he on Death Row?
For rape and murder.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Is everything OK?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
The same. Same as what?
One in a million recover.
Sure, Dad.
What are you doing here?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Maybe. She's OK.
No.
Again!!
I hate reading.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah. I know.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Well get someone down there!
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
What are you talking about?
Are you going to kill us?
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
She's as good as gone...
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Excellent...excellent!
Excellent.
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Dissent?
Drop the anchor!
Possibly some coffee?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
General Schmuck?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Yes, sir.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Condition Red!
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
And if that were true?
To peace on earth.
Ask away, Major.
I'm trying to, sir.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
That's close enough, Major.
I guess so.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Right.
Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.  I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
I presume the planes are armed?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
I've got one.
Shoot, Lothar.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Listen, give me a shot quick!
You tell me.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Sorry, King.
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Forget it.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
It was pretty bad, huh?
What did you guys think?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Now?
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
That's the rock star thing.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Sorry.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Hey, you know me.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
No, no.
I know, man.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Y- s-sure it did.
What?
Look.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey.
Yeah.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
Are you talking to me?
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Oh, you were there?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
A reel?
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
He is?
He is.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's a mistake to think that.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Thank you.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Sooze wants to see him.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
I don't know.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Look, your trespassing.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Yes, I stand for -
Jeff. Jeff.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Mm-hm.
Mm-mm.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Mm.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
What?
Just go.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I don't know.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
You do not want me to do your cover.
If...
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Come on, Jeff.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
Look, it's really not my fault.
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
You just became a statistic!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Let me explain something...
We're here for you, Diane.
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
I'll take it.
What's wrong with it?
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Why, you sweet kid.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I didn't.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
You'll be waiting for me?
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
He thinks it could be made into something.
I was afraid of that.
I tell you this is half sold.
So long.
Well, for heaven's sake!
What about all those ideas you had?
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
We're engaged.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Nice job.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Come on, Joe.
Yes, I did.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
Uh-huh.
I will not have it butchered.
I don't know.
Thank you.
You can stay here.
I'll take care of that.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
A little.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What's that?
"Mad about the boy."
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Where are my cigarettes?
Good night.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Goodbye.  Norma.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
You made her a star?
Along is no good.  I need it now.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
No, a super girl.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
Maybe it was just an accident.
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
We can't do that.
Let me kiss you.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Well...I guess one is all right.
Terrific.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I did.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
And you think you're in love.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
You vicious--
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I don't understand.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
You sure?
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
I have to talk to you.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
A cheap trick.
For what?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Why?
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
It sure is.
But Lana, you could --
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
Oh...I came close once.
There's a lot of choices here.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Uh-huh.
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Sure.
Yeah.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
So where is all them half-centses?
Uh...
That what they call you?
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
They ain't got captains?
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
A computer.
You designed it?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Can you do that?
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
No, we're just going down.
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Why do I have to do this?
Where's the handle?
Don't cry, Bubba.
Where did it come from?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Actually, yes.
Be my guest.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
What??
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Now This I want to hear.
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Shhhhhhh!
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Stay. I will come to you.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Lacy. . . I . . .
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Absolutely!
I'll try. . .
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
. . . And  very na�ve!
An angle?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
A toupee that flies?
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
He's thirty-five years old.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
A hot story, huh?
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know son, I know...
Not really, no.
What the  --  !
You described the exact contents of my purse.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Come again?
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're not the only one.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Besides that.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
There was a recipe on the back  --
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
Of course I can. I love you.
And if I don't obey?
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
He'll be weightless.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
It must feel great.
What about it?
Very much.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
I...uh...check.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Ally.  That's right.
We're...not together.
What happened?
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Why did you do that, Billy?
About the Ottos?
And they loved Bear.
For rabbits?

From what?
From what?
Berry-picking.
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
Isn't it a lovely day?
It's interesting.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
You seem very sure about that.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Crafts?
How old is she?
Daddy?
I tested positive.
Do you have the blood test?
Well, let's see what we get.
Yes.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Excuse me?
No.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
You are?
Yes.
I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Will the police do anything to her?
You don't know that.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
I only had a few hours.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
J.J., Steve isn't...
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
The man in jail is always for freedom.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
He wants me to break a leg?
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Nothing...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Why not you?
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Yes, but why?
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
If the stores are open -
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
Now listen to me very carefully.
No one must follow your work.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Pain causes it?
No.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Where you going?!
I'm sorry, John.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Can you get us in there, past security?
Yes.
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
I don't know.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
That's big of him.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
Your manner.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Let Furtw�ngler go. Please.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Yes.
Three months.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw�ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
That is correct.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
How?
And what did he say?
I have no idea.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
Do it, Helmuth.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Who's he?
When you got to the crescendo.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtw�ngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
I'll do the same for you sometime.
You're a big help.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
I don't understand...
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
You're not supposed to.
Cover...our footsteps...
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Why?
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
God, wake up, it's a con!
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
What are you talking about... ?
I don't know.  A lot.
Get us out!
You call them...
... what... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
Stop talking...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Happy Birthday, man.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Yeah.
You need anything?
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
I'll call them, okay?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Have you gone to the police?
Of course, Nick...
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I'll call.  I really will.
I know.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
No, you didn't...
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
No.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
What about the house?
She got the child labor stuff from me.
Just stay there, Nell!
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Yes.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
Then who called me?
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
But the experiment was a failure.
So far.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
I know.
David.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Where do we go?
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
We'll find him.
Let him break - he likes to break.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Not me, man.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Uh-huh.
Really.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
He give me your address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Are you serious.
Depends, don' it.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
And how did you get it?
It didn't discourage you, though.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
What's in Big Sur?
Yeah, I guess you are.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
He had urgent business in the north.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
There is?
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
And you should tell Doris...
Yeah. Thanks.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...Uh-huh.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
You're an enthusiast.
Birdy--
No. Uh... family friend.
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Ed.
Cash?!
Sure.
All right.
How's business, Dave?
What is it, Dave?
Uh-huh.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...You know... who *who* is?
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
I, uh...
Honey?
Dave.
How's that?
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
So--
So, who should I--
I don't work here. My wife does.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
...Nah.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
The hell with it, Eddie!
Yeah?
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Homicide.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
His eyes are open.
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
I believed them.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Apparently it's huge.
I think I should come with you.
What is it?
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
I know.
What's that doing here?
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
You're right.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
Don't stop now.
Yes.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Quiet.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
How about lunch?
You have time to talk?
And John?
I don't understand.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
What happened?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Wounded?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
One.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
No, hold back...
All prop cars accounted for?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Saturday?
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
Your Dad?!
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Did something happen today?
What's the hurry?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
You're the one talking to the walls!
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
It looks so small.
When you get to Fiji?
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Good.  Good.
Me?
Yes. I know.
Agent Mulder.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
Yes.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Kurtzweil, we think.
Yeah, I did.
Old friend of your father's.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
You know my work?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
What did it look like?
Your guess?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
I'm on the roof.
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Mulder --
All the equipment is brand new.
I don't know why I think they went right.
Mulder --
Run.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
On whose orders?
And they want to blame us?
I have answers for you.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Driver.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I do it all the time!
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I know him.
What happened to Charles Gish?
Tell me.
Yes.  I am.
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
No problem.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Delano?
You're kidding me.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Awaiting his arrival.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Ja, ja, ja.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Silly looking bunch.
Need we go through it all again?
In German?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Oh...
I shall be all right.
Oh, the usual things...
We loved each other, do you mean that?
It's true then?
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Fellow called Lime.
Martins.
When did you see him last?
No.
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
I can't. He disappeared...
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Of course.
I said you win.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
One can't just leave - please.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
I have guests waiting.
You remember me? Upstairs...
What does he say?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Funny?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Okay.
Here.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Thanks.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Not too bad.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Incredible.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don�t try then we'll never know.
They don't have extermination camps.
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
Fire...
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
That's stupid. Why would they?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
I told you, I'm good at this.
You gotta get out of here.
I didn't realize you cared.
What'd you say?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
A poison...?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Who? How would I know him?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Give me a reason not to.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
What were you, following me?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
The mother.
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Why me?
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
What are you trying to say?
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
The Italian, I presume?
He seems to have won it.
I think I'll have a coffee.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
What was he like, when he was little?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Italy!
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Great!
You're staying at the hotel?
Your mother?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
No!  I would never cheat you.
In the lake?
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
I'd better get back now.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
You'll try again tomorrow?
Anything.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
They got the new T.V.
No.  I'm just depressed.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Then, goodbye.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
What's up?
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Yes Esther.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I forgive you.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Do what you must.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
You really think so, Charlie?
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
Who?
At four. He will be there at four.
What, senorita?
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
Oh, that's so interesting!
No. I'm quite sure.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
To the eye? Like other men.
Not! I tell you. No!
That was unfortunate.
They do, but -- there are no lights out there �- they'll just be shadows -�
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
On his back, I suppose.
Get it out of here!
I don't know �� a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ��doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ��nobody on the streets at night ��
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
You. Us.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
You a tourist?
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
Perhaps it wasn�t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
What... What are you talking about?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
Perhaps I should come back when you�re...
I... If you don�t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There�s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
How... When did you...
Leon�s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon�s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I�d exceeded his expectations.
I don�t.
Five years of it. Surely, you�d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Where is that?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it�s never that complicated really.
My husband didn�t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
Yes. I�m trying to reach a friend but I can�t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
You...  Jesus Christ!
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Yeah.
How come you�re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Right... Well, I�ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Who�s the guy? Who�s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I�d have had to kill him.
It�s up to you whether they walk or not.
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I�m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But he�s a good guy. He�ll listen to you. He won�t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
What�s this place? A hotel of some kind?
What?
Finsbury Park. We�re in Finsbury Park.
What kids?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Good.
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
I didn�t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
I�m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
Anything at all?
Anything at all. I presume you won�t want to take the boy with you when you�re finished?  There�s a �500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Huh... I�m sure there�d be lots of takers.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Yes. You wouldn�t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Should I be?
I�m afraid I don�t understand.
No...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, I�ll stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Gluck.
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It�s wrong. Fucking wrong.
What do you think?
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
To be killed in battle?
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
I tried to.
Yes...
Yes, but...
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Where... where am I?
Who are you?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
Many things...
You have nothing to regret...
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
Buying her?
I understand.  How much?
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Go and ask him yourself.
His face.
Does he have hair?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
For what?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
The bridge won't wait!
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
But my voices... they promised me...
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Because... because you just can't!
It's not possible...
My king.
Playing...
I -- I -- I...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
What do you mean, they won't come?
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
What are you doing on the wall?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
I need to confess.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Yes, it is.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Wladek, please.
I'll see you...soon.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Tough luck.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
That makes a change.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
What did you pay him?
Hungry.
Bitch!
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
I've been worried sick.
Where are we going?
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Like it were a piano?
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Everyone has to practice.
What happened?
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
What's the line on Visitation?
Billie.  You ready?
No, no cops!
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
Here.
I had some appointments.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Which way did he do, Eirie?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
There's always a depression on.
Mottola.
Who's got the contract?
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Neither are we.
Yeh, it was easy.
No, not a thing.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
You're more gutless than I thought.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
It isn't any better.
What the hell for?
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
He'd like to kill me.
All right, when?
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
I don't know, figure something out.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
You weren't hired to miss him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
It's all right.
Just a minute...
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
And don't ever try to see me again.
Do you think I care
Dorothy!
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
Now do you believe me!
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Forgive me.  How are you?
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
If you think it'll be all right.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
He's all right.
Better get home before it is.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
No.
No.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
He's holding out on you.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Goodbye.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Let him have his say out.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
No word at all?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
You're always teasing.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
This is your party.
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
I had him out this morning.
They were kidding you.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
I'll get some towels. 
Yeah.
You must admit I have good taste.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
Not with all your money!
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Who do you think did it?
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
I know I left them there.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
For climbing.
Yeah.
I heard!
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
You don't know that.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
What are you doing?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
I did it!  I got the box open.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
We're not going to do anything.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
How!?
We'll find our way!  We'll...
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
You sure you want me too?
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
And then what?
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
The...the gold...
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
But...
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
That's in two days.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
It doesn't mean anything.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
All last night he could have been--
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
4732...?
Eat your dinner.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
What?
No....I though  I'm afraid.
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
No!...No!...
We're leaving.
But you can't.  We must escape.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
What?
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
Too late....stay close.
I don't know.
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
...to me.  I think I'm dying.
Where are they?
Hang on.
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Anything else I should know?
Only once, at Redstone.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Your partner?
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Driving in circles, waiting for-
What's wrong?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
I don't know.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
We work fast enough for you?
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Nothing so far.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Fuck factor ten.
What was it this time?
Quiet!
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
Yes.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
Where did you find it?
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
No!
Umm.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Like it?
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
You can trust me.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
I've got to see you.
Just as you say, Doctor.
I would like to.
Thank you!
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Two fifty-three, five--
They're all right, aren't they?
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Yes.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Ye-es?
Um-hum ...
You would?
And you're going to fall for them.
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
I <u>believe</u> you.
Giron...!
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
Yes, madame!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
For all the really important things--
He started it.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
I felt like black.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
Almost as good as you.
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
We've struck ice.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
I've got you. I won't let go.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
So don't marry him.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Jack, I --
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
He couldn't have.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
That's enough.
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Will you leave me alone?
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I don't understand.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Guess again, copper.
Sure!  Excuse me.
Want to take it back?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Good-by.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
Tell me.
Well, I can't.
When?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
Sally--!
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Who with?
What do you know about them?
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Not a chance.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Well, did you find me?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Like it?
No--not much--excepting-- 
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Get that out of your trunk.
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
Thank you.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Isn't that a daisy?
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Good.  That's real good.
This brand.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Say when.
Enough?  Never.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
No.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Easy now... That mare's in season.
What about her?
Room service.
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Always?
You feel bad about this?  About me?
Wait!
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
All right, run 'em off.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
I'll be damned...
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Jack...
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Wyatt...
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Not all of us, 007.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
How is old Q?
I see...
Step into my office.
... Kids?
You too.
Let's not make it a habit.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
I hope so.
- The family jewels?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He's killed closer.
No. I'm going with you.
My father left me the business.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
And when might that be?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
Kill him! Finish it!
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Since when?
What did your wife get her?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Yes.
They're too big.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I ought to break your damn neck.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
How old are you?
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Why in the h...
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
It is just a regular card.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You all act like two roosters.
Hush.
How is the garden doing?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Well, I would appreciate that.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
That's nice.
My mother passed on years ago.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
No, I haven't seen him.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Where?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Shield your eyes!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Yeah, right.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
I don't know!
Look!  Janie!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Will you quit moving around?!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Right here, Woody!
There's not.
Didn't you know he made things?
Home is where the heart is.
Living with him put years on me.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Ah, come on now!
You're late for breakfast.
I don't know what you mean.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
This is different.
She asked me not to.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
I don't know.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
I don't know.
You do?  What else you do?
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
Depends who it's from.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
Not in...
I don't believe you.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
What's he doing up here?
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
Not this time.
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
If I can.
A small thing.  Nothing really.
It could mean that, yes.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
No. On you go.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
You were in my way.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Is that a promise, then?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What happened?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Now?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Right.
OK, so who was it, then?
You don't know, do you?
Who wrote it?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
I don't rate that at all.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
So?
Four Grand.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
Pavel.
I don't have a clue.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
And that is?
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Damn.  Let's go.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
That's a little vague, Spock -
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
It must be all those marsh melons.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
I'm afraid of nothing.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
You are mad!
No special conditions?
Because you, too, must know.


I know you better than that.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Hi, Flynn.
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Of what?
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Yeah, I... oops!
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
How about you?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
What's wrong with that area?
It's too far!
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
You're getting out of the business?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Why is everything...like this?
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Where's Flynn?
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Yes.
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Stay on him.
You want me to just hang-- ?
It can't be.
I still don't believe it.
Put a tap on her phone.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Not exactly.
Sure.  Say that now.
Me too.
Good thinking, honey.
I'll handle it.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
Uh huh.
My husband the hero.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
My husband can't know about this.
I think so.
No.  Doris.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
It makes you tell the truth?
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
Yes.  Go ahead.
I understand.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
Worse than Cairo?							*
I'm sorry, I can't.
I don't know.  I have to think...
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Burt Reynolds.
Very much. Now, where were we?
What kinda music do you like?
What are your turn-ons?
Turn-offs?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Five.
You didn't do nothing.
I don't believe so.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Tomorrow.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
What's this acting class guy's name?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
No problems on both counts.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Do you still have friends on the force?
What makes you think I could do that?
Do tell. Why drug related?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
No.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
They didn't tell me.
McTeague.
Step inside.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Or a bit player -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
Do you know where we can find him?
No.
What are you going to do with us?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
I have to go.
Hiding?
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
James, why don't we...?
Shot!  Who shot you?
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
Give me the gun.
It was?  I didn't...know.
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
I'm not crazy.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
He's been tested for drugs?
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
How much.
Harlin around?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Don't look like nothing.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Please, just leave the car alone.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
I want my car.
Let me have a Beck's.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
Wrong number.
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
I'm just going to my car.
Do you have to call me that?
May I carry your package, Grace?
You sure you can manage?
I just drove in this morning.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Those are white words, not ours.
Come here.
The same thing you do.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
We'd have to kill him.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Give him the money.
But I want to say with you,
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
A lot that means.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Wait a second--
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
About things.  About your wife.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
How do you put a price on murder?
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
How about I pick one out for you?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Stand up.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
I didn't do anything.
And you're taking?
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something, old man?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
What do you want for free?
What?
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
I'm a solid man.
Live there?
Would you kill her?
About what you said this morning.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I'm not rambling.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
And tell her what?
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Will you shut up!
So?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
May I carry your package, Grace?
Accident.
You're welcome, Grace.
What happens when you lose?
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
What?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
You love him?
Is that why you're with him?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
I'm sorry...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
I'm not sailing his boat.
But I thought --
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Get in.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
"Arkady"
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
How much?
One way, or round trip?
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
What was that all about?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Yes.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
Oh.
Yes. Is this David?
Rust?
Think carefully?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I don't know what you're asking?
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
What's he look like?
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
There's nothing to do.
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
I lied.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
You're lying.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Did you get up from your seat?
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
Where is it?
All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Like whores?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Building his porch!
'Course he's coming.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Yup.
All week?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
What?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Maybe I ain't.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
I can't see 'em.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Sally?
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
The Kid, yeah...
Did I what?
No... I meant...
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
That ain't what I mean.
And ?
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Just forget about it.
I love you.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
They fucking know everything.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
What do you care what he says?
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
I work for Keyser Sate.
What about Redfoot?
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
Which is shit.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
I know he was good.
I just want to hear your story.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Ah.  How did they treat you?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
We went to Code Blue...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Tell me one?
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...We did everything we could...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
I...
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
It was good of you to meet...
That's what I'd planned to...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I.  Yes.  It is.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
Thank you.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
The most respected ...
No.
I've got nothing to say to you.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
Mr. Concannon...?
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
How come you're calling me from...?
Why?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You, you don't under...
What are you going to do?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
What difference can that make...? All right...
The broad has disappeared...
It's locked.
... You saw her?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
She did?
Yes, that's correct.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
How long have you been back?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
I -- I --
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Let me come in.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
But you haven't lived here long.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Because I remind you of her?
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow morning.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
That's not very complimentary, either.
Please! And don't look at me.
I want to! Come on!
But why?
Yes.
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
All in good time.
How does it work?
No! Let me go!
We're going up the tower.
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
What are you going to do?
Some money.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where were you?
This afternoon.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
What?
We have.
Shopping?
I don't like them.
Why?
No.
When?
How do you know?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
It's all there. It's no dream.
Yes.
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Please answer my question.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
More than you think.
It wasn't your fault.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
That's following a train of thought.
Well?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Could be.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Do you know him well?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Where?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Excellent.
I didn't hear you.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
What did you say?
I'm not getting a ticket.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
What does that mean?
Any time fat boy!
It has worked.
I got children. I've got a life.
Later.
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
I won't do it.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
Where's the bathroom?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Lois please.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
That's right.
Shut up.
I'm talking about prayer.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Shut up Boyd.
Say it again.
What?
What does that mean?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm serious.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
It's my fucking opinion.
You have a King fantasy.
Take Mexico.
Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
Ball park sausages.
Government cutbacks.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Yes.
What else have you forgot?
Don't you dare.
He's a moron.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Maybe.
I will.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Can we just talk this out?
Yeah. You.
Do you love me?
Call the police.
But...
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Like how?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
How do you know she's dead.
Greenpeace?
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
What song?
I do.
That's our plan.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
Are there many windows?
Then it's a respectable house.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Never.
Evil.
No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
And in the vegetable plot?
Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
What are you going to do?
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
No.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
He couldn't get through the door, then?
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Me? What did I do?
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
What's the assignment?
What did you find out?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
Do I get to see it or not?
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Enough!
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
You know I am.
I'm doing the best I can!
You like baseball?
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
Why's that?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
What if he's busy tonight?
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'll see you at National.
Who would find out?
...they sound what?
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.

Fine. 
...what are we going to do...?
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
We're locked into Albania.
Whaddaya think?
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
We have some mutual friends in Washington.

Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
Mmm.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Get on your feet, boy.
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...

No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...

Fine.  Good.
Jim Belushi...?
Surest thing you know.
Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...

You'll grow old.
Oh really.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back.

Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
We are?
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Excuse me sir.
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What makes you think you can?
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Gordon.
Excuse me.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
I gather you're a decorator.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
About what?  About us.
Ok toots, I will.
Hi
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Good evening sir.
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Who's is all this?
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Six six and six
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Maybe before the event, never after.
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
You guys are being real assholes
YES!
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
So much.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
What?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
You're joking.
Nope.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
Um...
I don't know.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
I've never even met you.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
And then you weren't there.
Right.  I'm sorry.
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
This is...
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
He was so pissed.
Stop.
She's making this up.
Good.  I'm good.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
What?
...no...no...no...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Did I?
Hartford?
I was down in Adamant...
No.
What are you going to do?
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Three o'clock.
Nice.  Almost done.
You know what I mean.
We did.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
More or less.
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You're kidding.
You didn't?
What?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
It's a ghost.
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Sabotage?
Then where is she?
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
The...
Claire...
She's gone.
Look for antiques...
Do you know it?
Mauduh...
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Two heartbeats.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Nothing was ever more false.
Every day  twice.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
I had you sent away.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
You - are - a - murderer.
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
He just went out like & light-
To love, you must be able to feel.

I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I do not understand...
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
Mm-hmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
I love you too.
Your beneficence.
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
A person could get killed round here just for working late
CHIC MAGAZINE?
Yes - I have had it for years.
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
What did you do with her?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I am sorry...
No worries
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Not ever. Never.
Check it out!
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
We own a small family grocery store.
It's my private business! Mine!
Well, why should I?
I guess.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Want a lesson?
The one with the horses.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I don't get the distinction.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
He's on the move?
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I see.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Not a chance.
That's hard to believe.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Only the best for my mother.
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I'm warning you.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Seldom? No kidding?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
And the child...
I know you do.
I understand.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Lombardo's settlement?
Unless what?
I net a guy in a bar.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Ray, you heard him...
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
And what do they say?
I said he did.
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
You can trust me.
Police -- God -- get a life.
Sam!  Hi!
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
God, I've been calling you.
And you believe her?
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
That's right.
That's cop bullshit.
That's right.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Shit. Here we go again.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Is this leading somewhere?
My disguise.  And here...
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
All what?
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
Relax.  We're almost there.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
In the next two minutes?
What is this?  A whole new train?
I'm sure we will.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You most certainly do.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
French?
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
This is Colonel Richards.
Dr. Loveless?
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
It's a smelting retort.
You managed alright.
Is this what's left of your army?
Me?
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
Why not?
Madmartigan.
He turned that monster into stone!
As above, so below.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Friend of yours?
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Nursemaid?!
Time to leave.
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
I did?
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
The limitless power of...
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Somebody has to do it.
He never misses.
I changed her already!
Who??
You're the guardian, aren't you?
Maybe milking.
Milking?
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
John, why?...
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Are they going to kill you?
What have you got?
Maybe.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Johnny �
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
I would not be too sure.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Only the elders.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
But Stoltzfus said...
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
But... You may not be well enough.
Not long... A few days.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
That's your way, not mine.
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Here. Whenever you want them.
I didn't even know about it.
Listen to me � Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
No...
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
They don't have any shit.
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
If she?
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Oh --
Oh!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
I have?
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh -- yes.
Oh, no -- no!
No --
Stop her!
Oil can....
Oh - I'll get it!
What sort of an animal is that?
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Yes.
Hah!
Oh, come on.
Did they hurtcha?
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Um-hmm.
To Oz?
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oh --
Did you just hear what I just heard?
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
I don't know.
What's the matter?
Oh, you did it yourself!
Here --   Come on.
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
NO!
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
A heart --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
It makes you nervous?
Yes.
Well, I --
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I�ve heard them all.
Alright then, brunch.
I did kill us. She thinks we�re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Elektra would control it all.
We can�t.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I took the initiative.
I�m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
They�re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can�t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
The inside man?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
It�s not the pin your father wore. It�s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
You don�t take no for an answer, do you?
It�s the only way out...
I have to go to work.
You had your chance, James. Now I�m looking for a bigger thrill.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I�ve never told anyone that.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Oh James.
Have some of the rat�s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
You're sure?
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
What are you up to?
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
Those cars.  What year is this??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Then why don't you ask him?!?
Jon??  You mean he's --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
But programmable. And expendable.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
Let's do this.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You're serious?
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
For what purpose?
I'll tell you one thing though.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
He takes his work seriously.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
You mutant bastards...
